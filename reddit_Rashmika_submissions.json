The occurrence occurred when a transport conveying Chinese specialists and laborers to the Dasu Hydropower Task site was designated.\n\nAt first, there was disarray encompassing the idea of the assault, with certain reports recommending it was a transport mishap. In any case, resulting examinations uncovered it was to be sure a psychological oppressor assault. The transport was hit by an impact, making it dive into a gorge.\n\n**Learn More:** [**https://worldmagzine.com/world/chinese-nationals-were-killed-in-a-pakistan-explosion/**](https://worldmagzine.com/world/chinese-nationals-were-killed-in-a-pakistan-explosion/)",

These celebs are a marketing tool for them so why would they hide their names? \n\nRanbir isn't on any of their lists and the only thing you find when you search for his PR is news articles that exist because of discussions on this sub. \n\nI have two simple questions: \n1. Why would one of these agencies have an exclusive offer just for Ranbir where they hide his name? An offer that even SRK couldn't get.\n2. Why wouldn't a rival's PR just expose who his agency is in an article or something? Considering how big of a deal it would be if he's deriving such \u201cgood PR\" because of it. \n\nMy guess is Ranbir probably has a manager or something who directly gives exclusives and plants articles but he probably doesn't have a coordinated agency.",

        "selftext": "Hi I am a muslim guy looking for a roleplay. I am 22 years old from london. I would want you to roleplay as the female in the roleplay. I am intrested in an interfaith play with you. Where you will be playing hindu woman. For the story I was thinking.\n \nI was thinking of a fantasy play where in this world there exists interfaith gyms: where muslim men are the trainers and hindu women are the members. Interfaith dating apps where strictly muslim men and Hindu women on there. Interfaith clubs where muslim men and Hindu women are only allowed. I was thinking we can meet in one of these options (U can suggest your own too!) We can make story regarding this where the girl can be a rss/bjp members daughter and ends up having a muslim boyfriend.\n\nWe can discuss the play more and fully plan out the play. The girl can be any actress we can choose during the discussions, but i would be leaning towards rashmika or rakul. Dm me if you are intrested. Also tell me the changes you wanna make we can discuss it together. To show that you read it dm me with the favourite word to describe us muslim men: mard, hunk, bull or stud.\n\nAll of the characters in this roleplay are 18+",

Another tweet i saw a week ago is how mamitha is going to be cringe soon and she is overrated etc..** \n\n\\[NO HATE\\] BUT I REALY THINK SHE IS GOING TO BE NEXT **RASHMIKA,** who is called cute, beautiful to cringe , overrated actress, just like how rashmika get a lot of hate from kannadigas she also going to get hate for acting in REBEL \\[not as much hate as rashmika\\] . just like 90 percent malayalam actress she is also going to other industry.\n\nshe is good in doing comic role which requires cuteness but thats it , she is soo bad in kho kho but okay in operation java. i used to think mamitha, nikhila , anaswara and darshana will stay in mollywood but her script selection really dissappints me , i am not saying actress should only do malyalam movies , in my opinion they should also do malayalam movies not like mamitha.

That movie was produced by Rakshit Shetty, a big name in Kannada film industry, and directed by his friend Rishab Shetty (who you might know from Kantara). Apparently they started dating and soon got engaged. Then, Rashmika got her Telugu debut but it was still fine until her second Telugu film Geeta Govindam where a kiss scene with Vijay Deverakonda sparked massive issues. Suddenly we hear that their engagement broke off due to \u201cincompatibility issues.\u201d \n\nAnd honestly if Rashmika hadn\u2019t broken off the engagement she wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as she has now. There\u2019s also an age gap of 13 years between her and Rakshit. Yes there\u2019s still riff between her apparently choosing Telugu over Kannada films more but she\u2019s banking on her success and massive opportunities in the Telugu industry than the Kannada one.",

For good or bad (that\u2019s not for me to decide) they\u2019re very possessive about their industry and the actors/actresses that come from their respective fraternity. Rashmika\u2019s Kannada isn\u2019t also very fluent because she grew up in Coorg where they speak Kodava and so she is also attacked for that. You\u2019ll see in almost all of her interviews especially during that early phase of her career, she\u2019s ambivalent about what language she should speak in because people criticize her for how she even talks. That\u2019s all to say that this is all messed up and I feel bad for her because she\u2019s a pan-Indian actress, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to end anytime soon.",

Kejriwal needs to explain the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s rampant corruption while the inquiry is focused on the liquor policy matter.\n\nHaving ignored the previous eight summonses, he is currently being called for questioning in the money laundering case related to the Delhi excise policy.\n\nAccording to [Delhi minister](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/delhi-police-apprehend-four-suspects-in-the-rashmika-deepfake-case/) Atishi, the DJB case appears to be a fallback strategy to detain Kejriwal and prevent him from running for office in the Lok Sabha elections. Regarding this, the ED and the CBI did not respond right away.\n\nOn March 18, Kejriwal is scheduled to appear before the central agency and provide a statement by the guidelines set forth by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This is the second instance in which the 55-year-old lawmaker has been called upon under the anti-money laundering statute.\n\n**Learn More:** [**https://worldmagzine.com/politics/disrespect-allegations-against-bjp-leader-following-new-ed-summons/**](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/disrespect-allegations-against-bjp-leader-following-new-ed-summons/)",

A stylish yet functional bag to carry your essentials can also be a great addition to your **Holi outfit**.\n\n# Safety First: Protecting Your Skin and Hair\n\nWhile embracing the festival\u2019s fashion, don\u2019t forget to protect your skin and hair from the harsh chemicals in Holi colors. Apply a good layer of oil or moisturizer on your skin and wear clothes like full-sleeved [**cotton kurtas**](https://janasya.com/collections/kurti-kurta/cotton?utm_source=organic&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=blog&utm_term=seo) that cover most of your body. Similarly, oiling your hair before stepping out can protect it from damage.\n\n# Holi Fashion Trends: Keeping It Chic and Comfortable\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[White Poly Silk Solid Kurta With Pant And Dupatta](https://preview.redd.it/dh1liii83noc1.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc54f5fa2f55ec837e9f6b62db8cda8606f96e25)\n\n2024\u2019s Holi fashion trends lean towards a fusion of tradition and modernity, with an emphasis on comfort, style, and sustainability.

Straight line and wdm ( elaborated)\n\nThen moved to extempore\nTopic - is social media really beneficial or not\n\nWill give you a gist\nTold any thing in this world has both good and bad sides and it depends on the individual how we make use of certain things. Started giving examples, gave rashmika mandanas example of how because of social media she was able to proof that the deepfake video was not hers , then gave Poonam pandeys example how she tried to raise awareness about cervical cancer through social media but ended up hurting people, wanted to elaborate more but they told time is over.\n\nThe female panelist asked my percentile  and told me thankyou and all the best.\n\n\n",

The SKM anticipates that more than 30,000 farmers from Punjab will arrive in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n# Farmers Protest\n\nThe \u201cmahapanchayat\u201d is taking place concurrently with sit-ins being held by other farmer unions at [Shambhu](https://worldmagzine.com/world/the-whos-regional-director-is-now-nominated-by-the-daughter-of-the-bangladesh-pm/) and Khanauri on the Punjab-Haryana border, namely the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha and SKM (Non-Political).\n\nFarmers have been calling for legislation to guarantee the legal validity of MSP for their crops, the adoption of the MSP proposals made by the Swaminathan Commission, pensions for farmers and agricultural workers, and the cancellation of farm debt.\n\nSupport has been offered by the SKM to the splinter factions at both locations. To step up their opposition to the \u201cpro-corporate, communal, dictatorial policies of the Modi government, to fight to save farming, [food](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/current-technology-does-not-allow-for-zero-emission-food/) security, livelihood, and the people from corporate loot,\u201d farmers will adopt a \u201cSankalp Patra,\u201d or \u201cletter of resolution,\u201d during the Mahapanchayat.\n\nThe mahapanchayat caused traffic jams in central Delhi, and the traffic police in Delhi have released commuter traffic advice. General secretary of the Congress, Jairam Ramesh, claims that without attending to the concerns of the farmers, the Center has let them convene a Mahapanchayat at Ramlila Maidan.\n\n**Learn More:** [**https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/farmers-protest-the-center-has-no-plans-to-address-farmers-concerns/**](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/farmers-protest-the-center-has-no-plans-to-address-farmers-concerns/)",

I feel perception has definitely changed towards her as a more serious actor who can deliver in complex roles and hold her own against top actors like Ranbir. \n\nIf it\u2019s about the awards - then yes she deserved more, but she must also be aware of how award shows work in India.",

I feel perception has definitely changed towards her as a more serious actor who can deliver in complex roles and hold her own against top actors like Ranbir. \n\nIf it\u2019s about the awards - then yes she deserved more, but she must also be aware of how award shows work in India.",

Then this should be never be considered an upset and I seriously doubt anyone with sane mind would ever call Samantha comparable in acting with Keerthy. Samantha is an incredibly poor actress while Keerthy is one of the best actress of this generation\u2026the comparison itself is damning to Keerthy. Every single actress except Sreeleela you named in that list are outright levels above Samantha interms of acting. Don\u2019t confuse popularity with acting, if this is a popularity contest then Alia triumphs over everyone.",

        "selftext": "Spoilers ahead, be warned.\n\nJust going over it, see if I missed anything.\n\nAlso, what about the very obvious parallels with the \"weird\" stuff that happens in this game? I feel like that's a big part of the plot we should focus on.\n\nThe overarching plot of \"what happened to the ancients thousands of years ago is almost 1-to-1 happening again today\".\n\n\n\nLong ago an alien landed on the planet.\n\nIt started to spread and spin illusions in the heads of the ancients and the humans.\n\nIt did so by appearing as their loved ones, even dead ones.\n\nIt is implied it screwed with the ancients and manipulated humans into a massive war against the ancients.\n\nIt appears Jenova feeds off the death and suffering on the planet it lands on, so it tries to cause as much destruction, sadness, and grief as possible.\n\nThe ancients fought back but needed to do so against 2 enemies: Jenova AND humans. Even though they managed to put Jenova to a deep slumber, the casualties were too much and the ancients bloodline was reduced to pretty much nothing.\n\nWhat remained of Jenova was a fossil looking like its final form before it got defeated; that of an angelic looking Ancient woman.\n\n\n\nSo far correct right? So when I go over the parallels with \"current day\" events, aka what happens in the FF7 game itself.\n\nLong ago an alien landed on the planet. ***Shinra awakened it again by digging it up, it escaped hojos lab. Hojo created countless black robes and other beings with Jenova cells. Jenova is once again spread across the entire planet. Most of these have this deep desire to head to a place where they could reunite, the reunion, essentially rebuilding a big Jenova entity.***\n\nIt started to spread and spin illusions in the heads of the ancients and the humans. ***Jenova cells are all over the planet. People see stuff that isnt real. Rufus sees Glenn for example. Cloud is constantly hallucinating. The party sees stuff like Jenova, Sephiroth, when they arent physically there. If you look past the cool boss fight visuals, they are essentially fighting air while tripping balls.***\n\nIt did so by appearing as their loved ones, even dead ones. ***Its happening again. It couldnt be more clear that its happening again with the Rufus seeing Glenn scenes. And Cloud, well damn he even almost kills Tifa thinking it isnt her. The old Jenova \"confusions\" and \"illusions\" seem to have returned. Believing loved ones arent real, dead people still being alive,... Here we are again. The game puts a massive focus on Jenova putting on the faces of the dead, and flat out shows it with the Glenn Rufus scene at the end.***\n\nIt is implied it screwed with the ancients and manipulated humans into a massive war against the ancients. ***Rufus got tricked into bringing the planet back into yet another great war. Shinra and Wutai going at it again is essentially another World War. He got tricked into by a... A Jenova vision. Ancients and humans in the past, well this time lets try Wutai and Shinra. As long as its war! DEATH EVERYWHERE! Rufus has figured out he's not seeing dead people, but Jenova visions, but it's too late. The war is upon us.***\n\nIt appears Jenova feeds off the death and suffering on the planet it lands on, so it tries to cause as much destruction, sadness, and grief as possible. ***With Sephiroth believing he is the son of Jenova, I'm taking his word for it. He even explains how grief, hatred,... is something to feed off. After all, , he is yet another one of these Jenova infected beings, just so happens hes the most powerful. Perhaps he is even powerful enough so that he is now the Jenova being in charge. Not a slave to the alien entity, but a commander of it.***\n\nThe ancients fought back but needed to do so against 2 enemies: Jenova AND humans. Even though they managed to put Jenova to a deep slumber, the casualties were too much and the ancients bloodline was reduced to pretty much nothing. ***The 3th game isnt here yet, but I can imagine they'll do a lot with how they have now set up an incoming war. As for what remained of the Ancients, Aerith is the last in that bloodline.***\n\nWhat remained of Jenova was a fossil looking like its final form before it got defeated; that of an angelic looking ancient woman. ***Same fossil dug up by Shinra, obviously. First placed in the Nibelheim reactor, then later taken to Shinra Headquarters (what was left of it after Sephiroth and the Jenova head fell into Mako)***\n\n\n\nI think the bigger story here is not how multiverses and timelines converge and all this weird stuff is going on.\n\nI think the bigger story is that the same horrors are happening again, and this whole planet may tragically be going full-on \"I dont know what's real anymore\". \"We are seeing shit that isnt there, and this entity is taking over again\".\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think, at least to a laaaarge extent, this is the overarching \"mechanics\" of this world. The A-backstory-plot.\n\nThe B-backstory-plot could be \"and also the lifestream is essentially a multitude of spiritual realities\". The C-backstory-plot then is \"And theres this Sephiroth guy who took control of this alien entity and now has the same if not even bigger goals and powers than Jenova\".\n\nAnd the main current plot being how our character are going to deal with all this going on. And we are seeing this mostly by playing as Cloud, a guy tripping balls and not being able to tell left from right. He doesnt know what's real, so why should we the players?\n\nYet we see post-death scene Aerith still walking around. We see Sephiroth (a manipulator) explain us multiversers. We see Zack doing stuff even if he's supposed to be dead. And then we look at it going \"oh look at the visuals, those are all real\".\n\n\n\nSo with everything above.... Why cant the following be reasonable?\n\nA) Zack is actually still dead and he's having a lifestream multiverse adventure, not on the physical planet surface. Where his body is probably buried by now. Yeah yeah it all looks real in his scenes, but if its a multitude of worlds build by the memories of the dead inside the lifestream, this would  work too.\n\nB) Aerith post death scene is alive alt-timeline Aerith or dead spirit Aerith? Dead spirit (force ghost) could certainly work. In death, as a spiritual entity of the lifestream, she may be doing this as a counter to what Sephiroth is doing. Very valid theory. But its also very valid that she's one of these fake Jenova visions. I mean the overarching plot is one of cosmic horror, it would certainly fit the theme. Heck, the Rufus Glenn reveal is placed right there in the end, between the scenes where Cloud sees Aerith after her obvious BURIAL in the water. Rufus figured it out, Cloud is experiencing it too but he didnt figure it out.\n\nC) Cloud getting the real black materia still happened like the original game perhaps? Like the burial scene, we just didnt see it. Down in the bottom of the temple ruins. Which we see him and Aerith conveniently fall into mind you, after we see the temple crumble into a black smudgy effect that then also went straight down into the pit. Even if this weird Sephiroth vision is going on. Convenient how Cloud went full unconscious there, mind being brought into some spiritual weird dreamlike consciousness lifestream-state. I say this because I found it weird how the game went out if its way to make Cloud and Aerith fall into the pit where the temple once was, then let Cloud wakes up much later in the forest. A whole scene was cut there in favor of the timeline weirdness reveal. Oh he also gets the white materia somehow here. Which later it turns out he's actually holding... a black one.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow sure are we this isn't still very much the same plot, just with a huge added layer of mindfuckery on top?\n\n\n\nAnother very \"meta\" and ironic parallel: I find it ironic that we all trail off in our own theory, as if we're seeing different timelines of what is going on in FF7. Instead of \"converging\" our theories and figuring it out together, we end up getting very heated in the arguments and end up in our own bubbles. Kind of like we are being misled by an overarching entity leading us into battle against each other, lol. Let's be the party members and not be fooled by Jenova Enix folks!",

What do you see as the upsides and downsides in regarding our A.I.s as \"artificial children\"?\r\n5. A.I. \"hallucinations\" are fictions that emerge amid factual data. Do you know of any that have proven to be so accurate, they could be characterized as lucky guesses, or maybe more?\r\n6. How is faith in the outcomes of A.I. like and unlike: faith in God, and faith in science?\r\n7. What  positive, non-deceptive uses of deepfake technology can you foresee?\r\n8.

Here is a link to Part 1 in case you didn't see it already!\n\n[Link to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bnpks5/part_1_i_thought_she_was_my_sister/)\n\nMy Account (continued):\n\nThe drive home was silent, between the hum of our car on the road and the darkness of the night around me, I quickly fell asleep. As my mind slowed down, and I faded from reality, dreams filled my mind. I saw myself from the third person, sitting asleep in the middle row. I was nothing more than an observer now, confused but comfortable.\n\nI saw my grandpa driving the car, my grandma sitting next to him, an indiscernible conversation taking place between them. My younger brother was also fast asleep just a seat over from me sucking his thumb and as I brought my gaze back toward the front of the car I saw my sister.\n\nI could see her through the rearview mirror sitting straight up, having positioned herself in the middle of the car\u2019s back row. She had one arm resting rigidly by her side, and the other arm was stiff and pointing straight up, bending at the wrist where her hand touched the roof. Her smile was wider than before, and there was drool dripping from the corners of her mouth.\n\nI watched in horror as she craned her head to the right, stopping when her gaze met my sleeping body. With one fluid motion, she swung her arm in my direction and then grabbed my throat. I tried to scream at myself to wake up, but as she tightened her grip, I watched helplessly as my face and lips began to turn blue.\n\nShe was now laughing, a deafening guttural laugh, my skin tone had now gone from blue to a dark violet shade of purple. Desperate to make it stop, I reached for my sister and pulled her shoulders towards me. She didn\u2019t budge. I tried again but to no avail. I was starting to panic now, pulling and tugging at her, watching as she only tightened the death grip she had on my throat.\n\nAs far as I could tell, she didn\u2019t see me or register that I was there. All she was focused on was my body asleep in the middle row. I needed to wake myself up, it was now the only option that made sense to me. I positioned myself next to where I was sleeping and began to repeatedly hit my face.\n\nThe sleeping version of me didn't seem to register that he was being assaulted. Not only was my deranged sister choking me out, but in an almost theatrical performance, I also was now punching myself hard enough to draw blood. My cheeks, forehead, and lips were purple, due to my lack of oxygen. My nose was broken and blood poured down my face and into my mouth.\n\nHorror spread itself through my body when I saw my sister suddenly yank her hand back, her iron grip still trained on my throat. With a wet, soggy sound, my throat was ripped from my neck, blood spraying the car landing on my brother and grandparents. Though soaked in blood they didn\u2019t seem to register what had just happened, and as I took in the crime scene before me that now looked like some sick version of modern art, my vision started to fade to black.\n\nI gasped violently as I sat up in my seat, goosebumps lining my small frame. I reached for my throat, afraid it was torn out but realized that was silly as I had just gasped for air. My grandparents must not have realized I was having a bad dream, as my grandma turned slightly when I woke and formed a pleasant smile.\n\n\"Hey grandma, how far are we from the house?\" I asked, my mouth still dry from sleep, my heart still pounding from the disturbing dream beginning to fade into my subconscious.\n\n\"We are almost home honey.\" Turning to my grandpa she said,\n\n\"Dan, how much farther we got?\"\n\n\"Only about 5 minutes. Pat, can you wake your siblings? That amusement park musta been exhausting, you three slept the whole way home.\"\n\n\"We were very tired. I will wake them.\" I said, still apprehensive towards my sister who was fast asleep in the row behind me.\n\nI shook my brother away, his eyelids fluttering as he fought waking confusion. Before I reached for my sister, I instinctively glanced in the mirror, half expecting to see her chilling smile staring back at me. Thankfully she wasn't, and still looked to be peacefully sleeping. I shook my sister but she didn't wake. I shook her again, but still no sign of her waking.\n\n\"Grandma, Stace won't wake up,\" I said facing the front again. \"I tried twice and she won't respond. Can you or Grandpa wake her?\"\n\n\"Sure thing honey, I'll make sure she gets inside. Must have been an extra long day for her, she has never been a heavy sleeper.\"\n\nMy grandma turned back to face the front and before long she announced that we had arrived home. I swung open my door and spilled out onto the half dirt half concrete driveway in front of the house. The sound of the ignition turning off amplified the already deafening silence, and the forest around me seemed to extend out towards infinity. My grandpa opened the door to the house and ushered myself and my little brother inside.\n\n*(I would like to take a quick moment to explain the layout of my grandparent's house before I get into this part of my experience. My grandparents lived in a fairly large and spread-out one-story house, surrounded by the forest. They lived just on the edge of their small town and there were only a couple houses near them in their small neighborhood. The house itself was old, seeming somewhat outdated, but besides that, it was a nice house. When you first enter the house through the front door, you are faced with a normal-sized living room. To the left is a staircase leading to the basement and a hallway leading to four bedrooms. To the right is a doorway leading to the kitchen, and straight ahead is another doorway leading to the dining room with a view of the backyard and the forest surrounding it. Also in this room is the guest bathroom, just big enough for one person. With the house laid out in your mind, I will continue.)*\n\nI walked straight through the living room and into the dining room, banking right towards the bathroom door. As I finished my business and turned to wash my hands, I heard the front door open, and my grandma speaking to someone on the phone. I dried off my hands on a dark green towel hanging next to the sink and then opened the door, stepping back into the second living room. The house was awfully quiet when I exited the bathroom, confused as I no longer heard my grandmother\u2019s voice coming from the conversation she was having on the phone just moments earlier. Where is everyone I thought as I slowly made my way back into the living room.\n\nThe only light in the living room was a small lamp, resting on a stand next to the couch, providing just enough light for me to see my surroundings. Everyone must have gone to bed I thought as I turned towards the hallway lined with rooms, yawning as fatigue took hold of me. As I got closer, something in me told me to turn around. My gut was screaming at me, begging me to abandon the direction I was headed in. I stopped just before rounding the corner, taking a deep breath to steady myself, the warning my body was conferring to me stronger than ever.\n\nPrepared to face the unknown, I rounded the corner and came to an abrupt stop just shy of the hallway\u2019s entrance. The light from the lamp behind me cast a small sliver of light down the dark empty hall. As I scanned the long corridor, I noticed a figure standing by the back wall. They had their back to me and were motionless, resembling a mannequin you would see on display in a Sears department store. I stood still watching the figure as it remained motionless, but as I looked closer I realized it was a young girl. Her hair was dark and messy, hanging against her thin frame. She seemed unnaturally skinny, her limbs offset by the grey pajamas she was wearing.\n\n\"He..hello who's there!\" I said, raising my voice, but only enough for her to hear me. Silence was her response, no movement almost as if my words had fallen on deaf ears.\n\nI opened my mouth to repeat my question, when a quiet but high-pitched giggle broke the silence reverberating off the walls of the hallway. The sound hit me and a wave of chills suddenly coursed through me. Instinctively I took a quick step backwards, resting my hand on the edge of the wall to stabilize my quivering legs. The ability to speak was now a notion of the past, as I helplessly watched the girl turn her shoulder towards me revealing half of her face-darkness obscuring her features.\n\nShe gradually raised her arm in my direction, and as if this were some cruel joke with a single finger motioned me to come towards her. At that moment, I saw the image of my sister in the crowd, half-turned and motioning me towards her with her finger. The girl at the end of the hall and my sister in the crowd were the same. A pitiful whine escaped my lips as I took another step backward entering the threshold of the first living room. I kept my vision trained on who I now thought was my sister, fear boiling up inside me.\n\nUp until this point, my sister had never done anything strange or out of the ordinary. She was very grounded and mature for being only ten years old, so this behavior she displayed today was bone-chilling. Her arm was still pointed in my direction, and as I looked closer I felt my body go numb. I tried to move but was frozen, unable to pull my sight from my sister. With no control of my body, I felt my foot lift and move me in the direction of the hallway. I no longer felt in control, slowly being drawn to the evil awaiting me at the end of the hall. Suddenly she spun to face the wall again, before she dropped her raised arm violently, bolting into the bedroom directly to the left of her. As soon as she disappeared from my view, I heard my grandmother\u2019s voice.\n\n\"Pat, could you come here real quick? I need some help in the kitchen.\"\n\nNow free from the grip that held me in place, I turned to face the entrance to the kitchen and called back,\n\n\"Coming grandma, uh just give me one second!\"\n\nNo longer wishing to see what would unfold next, I started in the kitchen's direction but stopped after a few steps, the sudden feeling of being watched too intense to shake. Turning around slower than I ever have, I looked back over my shoulder to the doorway my sister had run into. In abject horror, I saw my sister peeking at me from around the corner of the door frame. Her horrific, stretched smile was on full display and her eyes were shrouded in all-consuming darkness. There was blood pouring out of her nose, and her neck was bent at an unnatural angle, almost as if it was broken. I stumbled backward, breaking from the trance-like state I had just found myself in. Practically falling into the kitchen, I saw my grandma washing the last of the dishes that were stacked in the sink. She turned to me, her hand outstretched a towel resting between her fingers.\n\n\"Here Pat, could you dry these dishes quickly for me?\"\n\n\"Uh yes grandma, I think I can do that,\" I said, grabbing the towel and then standing next to her picking up the first plate from the soap-soaked stack.\n\nAs I dried the dishes, I couldn't help but imagine her still there, now farther up the hall peeking at me from another doorway. Any second now she was going to come bolting towards the kitchen on all fours, like the girl crawling out of the TV in the movie The Ring. As I set the fourth plate down though, I knew that she wasn't going to be coming any closer tonight.\n\n\"Hey grandma, I have a question,\" I said hesitantly, the fear of her giving me an answer I didn't want to hear present in the silence that followed.\n\n\"What's on your mind, Pat? Something bothering you?\" her eyes were trained on me, and I knew she could see the jumble of emotions proudly presenting themselves to her through my heavy eyes.\n\n\"Did Stace come inside tonight? I know I couldn't get her to wake up when she was sleeping in the back of the car.\"\n\n\"Your grandpa said he saw her walk past your brother's room, he assumes she went to her bed. The car is locked and I didn't see her when I looked through the front windshield. She should be inside now, Why do you ask?\" Her voice seemed to trail off as she finished her sentence as if she was suddenly much more interested in what I had to say.\n\n\"It's probably nothing, but I swear I saw her smiling at me again from the end of the hall. It was the same face she made earlier in the crowd. It was dark though and I couldn't see very well. Maybe it was just the shadows playing tricks on me.\"\n\n\"You know Pat, you've had a long stressful day. Don't let it bother you too much, I bet it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Let's finish these dishes so I can bring you to bed.\"\n\nI nodded my head to signal I understood and then focused my attention on the dishes in front of me.\n\nAfter a little while I finished the dishes and followed my grandmother out of the kitchen towards the hallway I had just run from. I felt myself hesitating as we neared it, a cold sweat breaking out on the back of my neck. Reaching for my grandma\u2019s hand, I grasped it and squeezed tightly in an attempt to stop the sudden onslaught of anxiety. I managed to keep my cool as my grandma brought me into my room and tucked me into bed. She then turned around and walked out the door, blowing me a kiss before disappearing back down the hall. I could just almost imagine my sister peeking through the small slit between the door and the door frame, her smile so wide it had split the skin at the corners of her mouth. Pulling the covers tight over my face, I hid myself from that thought, counting imaginary sheep jumping an imaginary fence, till a light sleep overtook me and my brain shut down for the night.\n\nThe next morning I woke to find my door undisturbed, the terror from the night before now no more than a distant dream. As I left the bedroom and entered the living room, I was greeted by the smell of bacon and pancakes, as well as the distinct and strong acrid smell of fresh coffee. I had never had coffee, but with how much my dad drank swore by it, I assumed it must be pretty delicious. I entered the kitchen to see my parents, grandparents, and two siblings, all sitting at the table. I felt hesitant when I saw my sister, but fought the urge to distance myself from her, though to me it felt completely rational. They were conversing, going silent between bites of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Plopping into my chair my mom turned to me and said,\n\n\"Morning sunshine, how did you sleep?\"\n\n\"I slept well enough, yesterday was interesting,\" I said, faking the cheery tone in my voice.\n\n\"I'm so sorry we weren't there for you yesterday when you got lost. We still feel so awful.\"\n\n\"Don't worry mama, I'm okay now I was just a little scared is all.\"\n\n\"I know honey, but your papa and I still feel bad.\" She said as she turned back to eat her food.\n\nI picked up my fork ready to dig into the feast before me, when my grandmother touched my hand from where she sat across from me.\n\n\"Pat, there is something I need to tell you this morning. Last night you asked if your sister made it inside. I told you she had, having been told by your grandpa that she went to her room. He was wrong though, and in turn, so was I. Your sister never made it in the house last night.\"\n\nInches from my mouth, my fork suddenly left my fingers and came crashing down on the ceramic plate that lay under it, the sound of metal on ceramic reverberating through the kitchen. Before I could truly process this information my grandma continued saying,\n\n\"At around 3 AM last night, your grandpa and I were awoken by the sound of someone pounding on the front door. Your grandpa left our bedroom quickly, grabbed his handgun, then went to investigate the disturbance. I got up shortly after I heard him unlock the door, and welcome in the sobs of your sister. She was crying and shaking, barely making any sense, but after we brought her in and let her come to her senses we realized what had happened. After your grandpa let you and your brother into the house, I grabbed our belongings from the car and went inside the house. Turns out, the stress and exhaustion from our mishap at the amusement park had caused me to forget that your sister was asleep in the back seat. I assume she had lain down on her side, blocking her view from the front of the car. I should have checked to make sure she had made it inside but I believed your grandpa\u2019s assurance that she was asleep in her room. Then you of course also asked me late yesterday if she was inside because you swore you had seen her. Regardless, she never made it inside last night, it seems crazy, but we left her in the car.\u201d\n\nI was overcome with the memories and visceral images of my sister smiling at me from behind the door frame of her guest bedroom. I no longer tried to hide the emotions I was feeling, horror awakening nausea in my empty stomach. This can't be true, God please don't let this be true. I saw her last night, I know I did. I'm not crazy, right? Am I? Was she not there?\n\nThoughts came flying at me from all directions, as I closed my eyes tight, trying to make sense of this horrifying confession. I realized as I sat at the table, drawn far from reality, late last night as I stood at the threshold of the hallway, I had been moments from meeting evil itself. Whatever had taken hold of my sister craved my innocent soul, needing it for a reason still unbeknownst to me. It had entranced me and I knew that if my grandmother's voice hadn't broken its grip, I would have blindly followed the evil that gleefully awaited my demise.\n\nThe rest of the trip was uneventful but far from peaceful. I chose not to say anything about it to my parents, aside from some small answers devoid of detail. I felt like reliving it and spreading the story would somehow give the evil more power, and a six-year-old didn't want to have that power lurking in his life. The events of that bone-chilling night with time became distant, but they were not out of my mind.\n\nI couldn't help but see her everywhere I looked. She was always there, hiding in my peripherals, smiling and watching. Part of me felt like she was in on it, but the other part of me saw her as my sweet caring sister. Maybe there were two sides to her, the hidden side only shown to me and the sweet innocent side on display for the rest of society. Either way, I had decided I wouldn't mention it to her and instead let the nightmare fade away like every other memory that entered the dark recesses of my mind.\n\nFifteen years later, I still feel the same as I did when I first saw her in the crowd of people at the amusement park. I have moved on from the fear of my sister, never having seen that smile again, but I still haven't shaken the terror that dug itself deep into me that night. Even now as I am writing this, a college graduate, fully immersed in the life of a 9-5 job, I still get chills when I let myself go back to the threshold of that hallway.\n\nI don't think I will ever understand what happened to my sister throughout that day. If her behavior in the hallway had been the only strange interaction I had with her during this day, I would have chalked it off as my mind playing tricks on me, forcing me to see things that weren't there. But the incident in the hall was the fourth time I had seen that unforgettable grin, and I know now that it wasn't a mistake or a \"figment\" of my imagination like everyone else had tried to convince me it was.\n\nI wish I could figure out what had happened to her. Maybe that's why I am writing this, hoping someone can help me understand. Was something imitating her? Did my sister have a mental break? Had I succumbed to a mental break? These thoughts and many more are all trivial though, and don't bring the intense fear like the one question I asked myself the day after this all happened. To this day I still ask myself and those few who I have told the account to this question.\n\n***What was waiting for me at the end of the hall, and what would have happened if my grandmother hadn't called me into the kitchen?***",

As I set the fourth plate down though, I knew that she wasn't going to be coming any closer tonight.\n\n\"Hey grandma, I have a question,\" I said hesitantly, the fear of her giving me an answer I didn't want to hear present in the silence that followed.\n\n\"What's on your mind, Pat? Something bothering you?\" her eyes were trained on me, and I knew she could see the jumble of emotions proudly presenting themselves to her through my heavy eyes.\n\n\"Did Stace come inside tonight? I know I couldn't get her to wake up when she was sleeping in the back of the car.\"\n\n\"Your grandpa said he saw her walk past your brother's room, he assumes she went to her bed. The car is locked and I didn't see her when I looked through the front windshield. She should be inside now, Why do you ask?\" Her voice seemed to trail off as she finished her sentence as if she was suddenly much more interested in what I had to say.\n\n\"It's probably nothing, but I swear I saw her smiling at me again from the end of the hall. It was the same face she made earlier in the crowd. It was dark though and I couldn't see very well. Maybe it was just the shadows playing tricks on me.\"\n\n\"You know Pat, you've had a long stressful day. Don't let it bother you too much, I bet it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Let's finish these dishes so I can bring you to bed.\"\n\nI nodded my head to signal I understood and then focused my attention on the dishes in front of me.\n\nAfter a little while I finished the dishes and followed my grandmother out of the kitchen towards the hallway I had just run from. I felt myself hesitating as we neared it, a cold sweat breaking out on the back of my neck. Reaching for my grandma\u2019s hand, I grasped it and squeezed tightly in an attempt to stop the sudden onslaught of anxiety. I managed to keep my cool as my grandma brought me into my room and tucked me into bed. She then turned around and walked out the door, blowing me a kiss before disappearing back down the hall. I could just almost imagine my sister peeking through the small slit between the door and the door frame, her smile so wide it had split the skin at the corners of her mouth. Pulling the covers tight over my face, I hid myself from that thought, counting imaginary sheep jumping an imaginary fence, till a light sleep overtook me and my brain shut down for the night.\n\nThe next morning I woke to find my door undisturbed, the terror from the night before now no more than a distant dream. As I left the bedroom and entered the living room, I was greeted by the smell of bacon and pancakes, as well as the distinct and strong acrid smell of fresh coffee. I had never had coffee, but with how much my dad drank swore by it, I assumed it must be pretty delicious. I entered the kitchen to see my parents, grandparents, and two siblings, all sitting at the table. I felt hesitant when I saw my sister, but fought the urge to distance myself from her, though to me it felt completely rational. They were conversing, going silent between bites of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Plopping into my chair my mom turned to me and said,\n\n\"Morning sunshine, how did you sleep?\"\n\n\"I slept well enough, yesterday was interesting,\" I said, faking the cheery tone in my voice.\n\n\"I'm so sorry we weren't there for you yesterday when you got lost. We still feel so awful.\"\n\n\"Don't worry mama, I'm okay now I was just a little scared is all.\"\n\n\"I know honey, but your papa and I still feel bad.\" She said as she turned back to eat her food.\n\nI picked up my fork ready to dig into the feast before me, when my grandmother touched my hand from where she sat across from me.\n\n\"Pat, there is something I need to tell you this morning. Last night you asked if your sister made it inside. I told you she had, having been told by your grandpa that she went to her room. He was wrong though, and in turn, so was I. Your sister never made it in the house last night.\"\n\nInches from my mouth, my fork suddenly left my fingers and came crashing down on the ceramic plate that lay under it, the sound of metal on ceramic reverberating through the kitchen. Before I could truly process this information my grandma continued saying,\n\n\"At around 3 AM last night, your grandpa and I were awoken by the sound of someone pounding on the front door. Your grandpa left our bedroom quickly, grabbed his handgun, then went to investigate the disturbance. I got up shortly after I heard him unlock the door, and welcome in the sobs of your sister. She was crying and shaking, barely making any sense, but after we brought her in and let her come to her senses we realized what had happened. After your grandpa let you and your brother into the house, I grabbed our belongings from the car and went inside the house. Turns out, the stress and exhaustion from our mishap at the amusement park had caused me to forget that your sister was asleep in the back seat. I assume she had lain down on her side, blocking her view from the front of the car. I should have checked to make sure she had made it inside but I believed your grandpa\u2019s assurance that she was asleep in her room. Then you of course also asked me late yesterday if she was inside because you swore you had seen her. Regardless, she never made it inside last night, it seems crazy, but we left her in the car.\u201d\n\nI was overcome with the memories and visceral images of my sister smiling at me from behind the door frame of her guest bedroom. I no longer tried to hide the emotions I was feeling, horror awakening nausea in my empty stomach. This can't be true, God please don't let this be true. I saw her last night, I know I did. I'm not crazy, right? Am I? Was she not there?\n\nThoughts came flying at me from all directions, as I closed my eyes tight, trying to make sense of this horrifying confession. I realized as I sat at the table, drawn far from reality, late last night as I stood at the threshold of the hallway, I had been moments from meeting evil itself. Whatever had taken hold of my sister craved my innocent soul, needing it for a reason still unbeknownst to me. It had entranced me and I knew that if my grandmother's voice hadn't broken its grip, I would have blindly followed the evil that gleefully awaited my demise.\n\nThe rest of the trip was uneventful but far from peaceful. I chose not to say anything about it to my parents, aside from some small answers devoid of detail. I felt like reliving it and spreading the story would somehow give the evil more power, and a six-year-old didn't want to have that power lurking in his life. The events of that bone-chilling night with time became distant, but they were not out of my mind.\n\nI couldn't help but see her everywhere I looked. She was always there, hiding in my peripherals, smiling and watching. Part of me felt like she was in on it, but the other part of me saw her as my sweet caring sister. Maybe there were two sides to her, the hidden side only shown to me and the sweet innocent side on display for the rest of society. Either way, I had decided I wouldn't mention it to her and instead let the nightmare fade away like every other memory that entered the dark recesses of my mind.\n\nFifteen years later, I still feel the same as I did when I first saw her in the crowd of people at the amusement park. I have moved on from the fear of my sister, never having seen that smile again, but I still haven't shaken the terror that dug itself deep into me that night. Even now as I am writing this, a college graduate, fully immersed in the life of a 9-5 job, I still get chills when I let myself go back to the threshold of that hallway.\n\nI don't think I will ever understand what happened to my sister throughout that day. If her behavior in the hallway had been the only strange interaction I had with her during this day, I would have chalked it off as my mind playing tricks on me, forcing me to see things that weren't there. But the incident in the hall was the fourth time I had seen that unforgettable grin, and I know now that it wasn't a mistake or a \"figment\" of my imagination like everyone else had tried to convince me it was.\n\nI wish I could figure out what had happened to her. Maybe that's why I am writing this, hoping someone can help me understand. Was something imitating her? Did my sister have a mental break? Had I succumbed to a mental break? These thoughts and many more are all trivial though, and don't bring the intense fear like the one question I asked myself the day after this all happened. To this day I still ask myself and those few who I have told the account to this question.\n\n***What was waiting for me at the end of the hall, and what would have happened if my grandmother hadn't called me into the kitchen?***",

        "selftext": "ik this is going to be a long post, so yeah.  \n\nTLDR: i wish i could have a easier life, but according to this guy\u2019s mom, she thinks i need therapy because i have poor social cues, i vent too much, tells me that her son (21) can\u2019t be around anyone who i associate with, or people who are ND like him. \n\nso, this guy\u2019s mother texted me with \u201cdo you really think you should be venting to people (your friends) about his autism? it\u2019s embarrassing that he has autism, and you venting about it embarassed the hell out of everyone in his family, you are a dumpster fire. You should try therapy, it would make your life easier. it makes my 16 and 14 yo\u2019s life easier especially that they go to a drama filled school.\u201d then his mom said \u201cyou're the side chick that\u2019s why i texted you off my sons phone. And he is not interested in you. Regardless leave my son alone.\u201d then his mom said \u201cAnd? His actions say otherwise. ((his friend who is also my friend) is lying to you because she set you and my son up, she even admitted it to me when i asked her through my sons account) Do you really want to be a side chick? i\u2019m sure you don\u2019t, but if you continue to talk to my son and find out the truth which you kinda do know the truth tbh. but fr, you should be with someone who is on your lifestyle, ND or NT\u201d. then his mom said \u201cleave my son alone! and if i find out you\u2019re texting him, i\u2019ll tell you that he\u2019s taking a nap.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, youre mad because i texted you off my 21 yos phone. he is incapable to be on social media without me or his father monitoring who he\u2019s talking to. you went to a drama filled school with questionable people at every angle. I\u2019d recommend that you seek therapy. my 16 yo ND son and 14 yo NT daughter go to the drama filled school and they\u2019re in therapy, and they avoid most of the people there except family friends, and sports friends\u201d. then his mom said \u201cBecause you\u2019re having trouble understanding that you\u2019re the problem. And it seems as though you confuse the drama that you surround yourself (however negative to others, but to durfee people it\u2019s normal to have drama and that\u2019s not good). i went to the drama filled school myself as a teen and i know how it is there. which is why my 21 and 19 yo didn\u2019t go to the drama filled school, sadly my 16 and 14 yo go to the drama filled school, but thankfully they\u2019re in therapy so they won\u2019t have issues with social cues as an adult. i personally went to therapy in high school myself when i was pregnant with my 21 yo. You also tend to need help recognizing the social cues that others give. A skilled therapist that specializes in your field can help you build positive life skills and improve your ability to recognize unhealthy patterns and behaviors. That is, if you\u2019re willing to be a decent human being.\u201d \n\ni understand that therapy can fix people, from what other people have told me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou have so much drama (due to where you went to school since it is a drama filled school) you vent so much about how my 21 yo blah blah blah, it\u2019s insane. you basically control him, like you felt uncomfortable when he stayed the night at his 17 yo coworkers house. And you always say no when i tell you to leave my 21 yo alone. There comes a time that you need to realize that no one can change anything for you. You have to do that. Good luck.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cBreanna, I do not mean this in a rude way at all, but.... Do you not have any friends in person? i would understand that because you went to a drama filled school, people there are all rude and snotty, you only fit in if your parents went there or you have family friends there.  If your parents didn\u2019t go to durfee or you don\u2019t have family friends who went to durfee, it would make sense that you didn\u2019t have real friends and were a loner due to not fitting in. as if you do not have someone in \"real life,\" to talk to. I also see from what my sister in law (maya) who is in a facebook group you\u2019re in, told me your mom is against therapy. I think it is pivotal for you to seek out therapy, and real friends. I know it can be hard to make friends, there are apps out there that can help you make friends, like yubo, bumble (friends version), wizz, discord servers, there is also therapy apps and online services since you don't drive, from what my son told me.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cI love that you\u2019re talking to people outside of your state, they seem more nicer!!! Sometimes people from the drama filled school are not the best to vent to. I suggest getting an app that has therapy. Do you have access to your insurance information? I feel as if a professional would be best. I know that with autism your thought process differs, I think getting a therapist will help show you thinking patterns and behaviors that could help you work through most of the struggles you are having due to being in a drama filled school as a teen.  Also possibly getting yourself an advocate., you can get them through social services. I feel as if you want to gain your independence but are struggling with the direction to take, due to being in a school where teachers cared more for drama then learning\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, it's time to leave my son alone, ik you don\u2019t wanna hear that tho deep down, but it\u2019s the truth\u201d. then his mom said \u201cyou always vent to your friends, but never want to listen to what i have to say and you just want pity.\u201c then his mom said \u201cI think u need to find a new hobby, instead of messaging my son\u201d. then his mom said \u201cI personally think you may help\u2026or a hobby at least\u2026so you stop venting about my son and about his \u201cautism\u201d it\u2019s cringe, idk why he has autism tbh, that\u2019s why when he got older (5th grade) i put him in sub seperate classes because it\u2019s more gen ed and not a bunch of mentally incapable people\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl you are a dumpster fire. I\u2019m calling bs on you being nd: if you were \u201cND\u201d, you would realize that your my 21 yo (who is ND) may have a mom protecting his routine and hinting to shut it off, and he has asked me for help to read to help him understand your cues. i personally think you were tested with the wrong diagnosis as a kid, and your mom is protective of you because it\u2019s common in your hometown (the same city i live in) for young adults to be sheltered, or barely hangout/go out with friends. which is why i got pregnant as a teen with my 21 yo so i can have a normal life as an young adult.\u201d \n\nthe fact his mom said i\u2019m probably faking my autism is actually just fcked up tbh. it sounds ableist imo, when she has 3 ND sons (21,19,16).\n \nthen his mom said on tiktok from what my friend (20, his friend) told me, \u201cFor the triggered drama filled school people who are in this group. You really should try to educate someone that has autism, instead of letting them have free time during the day.  I don't need to be told about the various types of autism. It's called a spectrum for a reason. Because it varies \ud83d\ude44 I also have 3 sons who are ND, it\u2019s genetic from my husbands side of the family. he isn\u2019t ND. So if anyone is gonna come at me, at least make sense. this girl doesn\u2019t want advice on WHY her behaviour isn't okay (texting my son, venting about my son and his autism). she thinks she is ND because he is ND, but she is nowhere near ND, she doesn\u2019t understand why i checked his phone, that\u2019s NT behavior.\u201d \n\nthen his mom commented \u201cif anyone defends breanna, you\u2019re embarrassing yourselves fr. autism isn't an excuse to be venting on the internet about a stranger you met on snapchat. And please don't refer autism as a \"disability\", because i am not proud that my 21,19 and 16 yo are ND, but sadly they are and can\u2019t live like a NT person. Her behaviour isn't okay in many of her little vents and she needs to be held responsible for it.\u201d\n\nmy friend (20F,his friend) commented on his moms post because it was on her FYP saying \u201cwhy are you being rude to her over the fact your son really likes her. Life is hard as it is. You can be kind to her\u201d. then his mom said to my friend \u201ci have a feeling she is NT, and is faking to be ND to get with my son, She seems too function just fine. 21 is incapable of a lot of things. 19 and 16 are more higher functioning. 16 is in sub separate classes at the drama filled school. 19 and 21 were in sub separate classes in middle school. I don't like people that use autism as an excuse to vent on the internet. ffs,wow. can't have a conversation That says more about your intelligence and why you\u2019re a stoner \ud83d\udc4c I've reported you on tiktok for being a $lut, I don't engage with people who post $lutty things on tiktok. They aren't worth my time. Have a lovely rest of the night \ud83d\ude18\u201d. then my friend said to his mom \u201cAutism is literally a neurological developmental DISABILITY. Just because you or anyone else might not see it as one, doesn't mean that it's not an actual disability. You can't compare someone else, to your 3 sons because nobody is the same as someone else. Everyone handles things differently and she never said her autism is the excuse for anything. She was mentioning it to better explain to you jumping down her throat, why she does some of the things that she does. she was venting to her friends, it doesn't matter if it\u2019s \u201cdrama\u201d, she's 20 years old and almost all 20 year olds have constant drama going on in their lives. you apparently have a problem with her venting but yet take the time to tell her negative things & rude attitudes instead of just being a decent person. youre literally talking about how she's all drama and telling her to grow up and how she's childish/immature and a whole dictionary worth of things, are also causing more drama that she\u2019s  complaining about. It solves absolutely nothing and only makes her feel worse. Do yourself a favor and leave her alone, because she's allowed to be here despite what she vents.\u201d then his mom said to my friend,  \u201cimagine defending someone who\u2019s possibly a victim of munchausen by proxy and trying too tell them what they should think. Girl. Sit down. You are projecting your feelings and I honestly couldn't care less.\u201c then my friend said to his mom, \u201cNice straw man argument, miss girl. In case you\u2019re confused, comparing one person\u2019s truth to another\u2019s is in no way a valid point. To point out that 21,19 and 16 do or say \u2018such & such\u2019, therefore breanna should be able to do or say \u2018such & such\u2019 makes no sense. Furthermore, and forgive my wording if not proper in this instance, but the level of ND from one person to the next is wildly different. Surely you know this since you too are apparently on the \u201cspectrum\u201d. (Hint: refer to dictionary\u2019s definition of the word \u2018spectrum\u2019. Actually, I\u2019m curious why you sent messages to breanna through 21\u2019s account? My point is: who the h311 are you to assert that \u201cshe seems to function just fine\u201d? Not that I agree with this convaluted opinion, but YOU don\u2019t even appear to believe that judging by your comments\u2026 like you think he isn\u2019t capable to be on social media by the fact you check 21\u2019s phone. i\u2019m ND myself as you know, and my mom is strict herself but she wouldn\u2019t go on my phone and text people off my phone.\u201d \n\nthen my friend @ me and said \u201canyone with a lick of sense can see that 21\u2019s mom opinion is weird & convoluted. Not sure why she\u2019s so mad, but u have done absolutely nothing wrong. you are free to vent, i know 21\u2019s ex or whatever dmed you on tiktok.  Please girl, don\u2019t pay any mind to her or 21\u2019s ex or whatever. Their opinions aren\u2019t worth your energy. Clearly she is in need of some anger management.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cThis reads like Blah blah blah, I'm literally acting like a victim over being attacked by 21\u2019s mom, and getting messages by 21\u2019s mom through 21\u2019s phone.  Move on with your life. it's super unhealthy that you care so much about someone\u2019s mom texting you through their sons phone.  Trust me none of this will matter in 6 months. Especially not if you're stoned while posting this.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cdue to you being in a drama environment school as a teen, You need therapy. It sounds like you come from a very toxic family (due to where you grew up) and don't know how to form healthy bonds with the outside world, due to where you grew up. This will only get worse for you if you don't get some help, i know all this because i went to the same high school you did and most people there are unhinged and enjoy drama. which is why i sent my 21 and 19 yo to a vocational school because there\u2019s no drama there and it\u2019s a strict environment. Please put the effort into yourself to heal from your toxic upbringing.  And please for the love of the earth, do not date until you've gone to therapy for a whole year. I hope my 21 yo never runs into you, anyone like you (autistic,ND) or anyone you associate with. my 21 yo will never be dating anyone from that red flagged a$$ school that graduated there, ain\u2019t no fckin way. neither will my 19 and 16 yo, my 16 yo goes there so i\u2019m worried he\u2019ll end up dating someone from that trashy a$$ school. thankfully my 14 yo NT daughter knows better and is dating someone from a vocational school. my 13 yo NT son is a good kid so he prob don\u2019t even care about dating tbh, he\u2019s the most decent 13 yo in this generation.\u201d then his mom said \u201cthe reason why to get therapy is because your unhealthy mindset wouldn\u2019t be a thing in you.  Life is actually is much better after therapy.  Everything is easier. my 16 and 14 yo are in therapy due to them being decent people and not being saints due to the school they go to, and it\u2019s helped them realize they are better off talking to people and having friends from decent schools who know better, and show your vents about my son to your therapist when you go to therapy because that will help them so much in treating you.\u201c then his mom said \u201chow many times are you gonna vent about my son and what i do with him do you need to do, and be told to grow up. All you do is vent about my son to your friends and why did his mom take his phone and message me and it\u2019s childish bull \ud83d\udca9 and you know damn well why i texted you through his phone. you are a STRANGER to him and to me, idc what that grimey a$$ friend of his tells you, she is manipulating him into dating you because she thinks i\u2019ve arranged him to date that girl abigale told you about. the one that\u2019s insane is you, you\u2019re absolutely off your rocker and it\u2019s making me think you\u2019re psycho, my sister in law (maya) even told me you\u2019re psycho because you mentioned you were mad over the fact he spent the night at a girls house idc if she was a minor, yes she was a minor, but why does that matter, me and his father grew up with her family so it\u2019s okay\u201d. \n\nmy opinion: the fact this woman checks his phone, but allows him to go to a bar is just WILD to me.. and first off, it\u2019s not okay that he slept at a minors house. he\u2019s 21 she\u2019s 17. \n\nthen my friend commented back to his mom, \u201cgirl take your pick me self elsewhere. My statement obviously meant \u201cwe\u2019ve all had drama\u201d You\u2019re grown. Act it. She\u2019s 20. You\u2019re all attacking her. Only people that need to grow up is YOU.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cno I've never been there\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this isn't normal drama. this is trashy school drama that she complains so much because i went through 21\u2019s phone how dumb are you because you normalize drama for some reason how did you survive private school in high school like tell me because you must have gotten bullied so hard in high school \ud83e\udd23 she needs to get real help.\u201d then my friend said to his mom, \u201cyou are being nasty to this poor girl not keeping in mind that she still has so much to learn about herself, and so much growing to do. Think back on how you were at those ages and how you are now. Those are two different people. Stop jumping the gun and immediately attacking her. There\u2019s ways to talk to people. Imo you need to seek help on the way you speak to people. Nasty bitter person imo.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cIt's when she asks why she could possibly need therapy that makes me irritated. She doesn't want advice she wants to be told she's right and i\u2019m wrong for checking 21\u2019s phone when he\u2019s incapable to be on social media\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cYou constantly vent about my son, and don't want me offering you advice on how to seek help. Clearly 20 (my friend) is so naive and dumb to see how you actually are. You NEED help or else you will never be happy. i hope if you still are with my son in the future which you guys will end up getting a divorce and you\u2019ll probably be a single mother because you\u2019re such a unhappy person, my grandkids better not go to that trashy a$$ school thankfully my son will not let that happen because he wants his future kids to have a good education and go to a good school one day. just informing you that, but i know you won\u2019t be sticking around with my son for that long\u201d. then his mom said, \u201cbut, you asked my son why i texted you through his phone. how do you not see that you\u2019re the problem? you have proven that you aren\u2019t letting it go with how you are so confused as to why an adult man\u2019s mother is texting you through their sons phone\u201d. \n\nbut, didn\u2019t this mother again let her son stay the night with a 17 year old, let her son go to a BAR.. yeah he\u2019s old enough to drink, but like she gets in his personal life that\u2019s the weird part to me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cOk, you are the one bringing the fact that i took my sons phone to text you, so who's actually the problem here. Grow up\u201d. then his mom said \u201cYou need to grow up. geez. So much drama about how i went on my son\u2019s phone to text you and you are causing it. this is not the day of our lives \ud83d\ude12\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201clike i said, She's literally 20 years old and Autistic. I doubt you were even \"grown\" at 20 especially considering our frontal lobes aren't even fully formed until 25.\u201d then his mom said to my friend \u201ci was mature at 20, i had 21 at 17, and 19 when i was 19. i had 2 kids already when i was 20. you need to realize that she is causing drama when it isn't needed. It happened almost a week ago, yet she has re started it by venting about it. Also, you need to realize that she starts it all by the fact she texted 21 at 2am one night. I suggest she engage in a psychologist.\u201d \n\nthen his mom told me, \u201cyou need to take accountability for your actions, you messaged my son at 2am, i had the damn right to text you to leave, there was no need to text him at 2am, idc if you were asking what he was up to or if you saw he was active online. it\u2019s disgusting for someone to text the opposite seggs at 2am\u201d. \n\nhow\u2019s it disgusting that i was asking him how his night was going\u2026.\n\nthen his mom said, \u201cWhy are you so drama filled? i get you went to a school that has basically drama, you literally walk around thinking why did his mom contact me through  her sons phone, Who in their right mind texts someone at 2am... nobody but you. You need a hobby that doesn't involve the internet or unhinged friends.\u201d \n\nmy opinion: \u201cunhinged friends\u201d is just irrelevant because that\u2019s just wild she assumes how my friends are. \n\nthen his mom told me to stop venting about her son. \n\nthen his mom said to my friend \u201cchill out, and if you would realize she vents about my son and that she is drama for it you would be a decent person but no you seem to like drama and that\u2019s who breanna associates with is people who like drama\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cyou are the type of person who asks why do parents get involved in their sons life while they\u2019re dating or talking to me, it\u2019s because you texted my son at 2am.\u201d \n\nthen my friend responded to his mom \u201cask yourself why you care so much. Move on. You do realize, that when you say breanna is just looking for drama... and you are actively sitting here for like over an hour arguing with her is giving her drama, right? Unless you're the one looking for drama. None of your comments were necessary. Talking about this young GIRL being nothing but drama and yet your initial comment was specifically to START drama. Make it make sense \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \u201c\n\nthen his mom said to me \u201ctexting someone at 2am is harassment\u201d. i wasn\u2019t even doing anything except asking how his night was going. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou literally blame me for your actions, you\u2019re genuinely poor, 20 (my friend) defending you is so delulu of her\u2026\u201d \n\nthen my friend told his mom to leave me alone. then, my friend said to his mom \u201cDelulu? Because i\u2019m defending my friend who\u2019s a 20 year old autistic girl, No. The Delulu one would be you that seems to think it's necessary to just attack this girl because she is venting about how toxic you are. She's trying to vent her feelings in the best way that she knows. If anyone needs to grow up, it's YOU that get off on bullying people on the Internet. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\nthen, his mom is telling my friend \u201cso you think i should leave her alone? the fact you\u2019re saying i\u2019m being mean towards her is just actually fcked, what did i even do like i\u2019m being protective over 21 and want what\u2019s best for him and breanna is no role model for him! wow\u2026 the fact this is how drama filled school people go through life being told they are always right when she is blatantly inviting trouble, she texted 21 at 2am nobody is online or active at 2am except poor people. her \u2018autism\u2019 aside is just embarrassing autistics and poor people are just the most troubled people in this world, she truly is troubled and needs her help with her other personality disorders that she probably has but wasn\u2019t diagnosed because the city doesn\u2019t know how to be doctors and diagnose people with the right diagnosis, Its actually troubling and people believing she\u2019s autistic is actually just so wild it\u2019s how dumb they are. do you not realize she is antagonizing me? i\u2019m literally being a great parent. she has made lots of peoples lives so bad and traumatized them\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201cthe fact you had to spread false information about her is just so wild\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen my friend told me \u201cshe\u2019s dumb as h*ll \ud83d\ude2d Like, hating on you for your feelings.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cI lost braincells. You definitely need a different hobby because you constantly vent about my son and how i went on his phone to text you. you are the problem. you\u2019re so senseless\u201d. then his mom said \u201cur victimizing yourself over me texting you through my sons phone. stop chasing after my son\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cYou are exhausting. U need to grow up and stop being childish imagine what you\u2019re gonna be like in a few years, god damn you\u2019re bonkers. you need help. you\u2019re absolute childish for what you did. texting someone at 2am is sick asf it gives stalker vibes. you don\u2019t get the fact you need therapy and the fact you asked why you need it is actually embarrassing. you will be in a healthy place mentally if you were to go to therapy.\u201d",

        "selftext": "ik this is going to be a long post, so yeah.  \n\nTLDR: i wish i could have a easier life, but according to this guy\u2019s mom, she thinks i need therapy because i have poor social cues, i vent too much, tells me that her son (21) can\u2019t be around anyone who i associate with, or people who are ND like him. \n\nso, this guy\u2019s mother texted me with \u201cdo you really think you should be venting to people (your friends) about his autism? it\u2019s embarrassing that he has autism, and you venting about it embarassed the hell out of everyone in his family, you are a dumpster fire. You should try therapy, it would make your life easier. it makes my 16 and 14 yo\u2019s life easier especially that they go to a drama filled school.\u201d then his mom said \u201cyou're the side chick that\u2019s why i texted you off my sons phone. And he is not interested in you. Regardless leave my son alone.\u201d then his mom said \u201cAnd? His actions say otherwise. ((his friend who is also my friend) is lying to you because she set you and my son up, she even admitted it to me when i asked her through my sons account) Do you really want to be a side chick? i\u2019m sure you don\u2019t, but if you continue to talk to my son and find out the truth which you kinda do know the truth tbh. but fr, you should be with someone who is on your lifestyle, ND or NT\u201d. then his mom said \u201cleave my son alone! and if i find out you\u2019re texting him, i\u2019ll tell you that he\u2019s taking a nap.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, youre mad because i texted you off my 21 yos phone. he is incapable to be on social media without me or his father monitoring who he\u2019s talking to. you went to a drama filled school with questionable people at every angle. I\u2019d recommend that you seek therapy. my 16 yo ND son and 14 yo NT daughter go to the drama filled school and they\u2019re in therapy, and they avoid most of the people there except family friends, and sports friends\u201d. then his mom said \u201cBecause you\u2019re having trouble understanding that you\u2019re the problem. And it seems as though you confuse the drama that you surround yourself (however negative to others, but to durfee people it\u2019s normal to have drama and that\u2019s not good). i went to the drama filled school myself as a teen and i know how it is there. which is why my 21 and 19 yo didn\u2019t go to the drama filled school, sadly my 16 and 14 yo go to the drama filled school, but thankfully they\u2019re in therapy so they won\u2019t have issues with social cues as an adult. i personally went to therapy in high school myself when i was pregnant with my 21 yo. You also tend to need help recognizing the social cues that others give. A skilled therapist that specializes in your field can help you build positive life skills and improve your ability to recognize unhealthy patterns and behaviors. That is, if you\u2019re willing to be a decent human being.\u201d \n\ni understand that therapy can fix people, from what other people have told me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou have so much drama (due to where you went to school since it is a drama filled school) you vent so much about how my 21 yo blah blah blah, it\u2019s insane. you basically control him, like you felt uncomfortable when he stayed the night at his 17 yo coworkers house. And you always say no when i tell you to leave my 21 yo alone. There comes a time that you need to realize that no one can change anything for you. You have to do that. Good luck.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cBreanna, I do not mean this in a rude way at all, but.... Do you not have any friends in person? i would understand that because you went to a drama filled school, people there are all rude and snotty, you only fit in if your parents went there or you have family friends there.  If your parents didn\u2019t go to durfee or you don\u2019t have family friends who went to durfee, it would make sense that you didn\u2019t have real friends and were a loner due to not fitting in. as if you do not have someone in \"real life,\" to talk to. I also see from what my sister in law (maya) who is in a facebook group you\u2019re in, told me your mom is against therapy. I think it is pivotal for you to seek out therapy, and real friends. I know it can be hard to make friends, there are apps out there that can help you make friends, like yubo, bumble (friends version), wizz, discord servers, there is also therapy apps and online services since you don't drive, from what my son told me.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cI love that you\u2019re talking to people outside of your state, they seem more nicer!!! Sometimes people from the drama filled school are not the best to vent to. I suggest getting an app that has therapy. Do you have access to your insurance information? I feel as if a professional would be best. I know that with autism your thought process differs, I think getting a therapist will help show you thinking patterns and behaviors that could help you work through most of the struggles you are having due to being in a drama filled school as a teen.  Also possibly getting yourself an advocate., you can get them through social services. I feel as if you want to gain your independence but are struggling with the direction to take, due to being in a school where teachers cared more for drama then learning\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, it's time to leave my son alone, ik you don\u2019t wanna hear that tho deep down, but it\u2019s the truth\u201d. then his mom said \u201cyou always vent to your friends, but never want to listen to what i have to say and you just want pity.\u201c then his mom said \u201cI think u need to find a new hobby, instead of messaging my son\u201d. then his mom said \u201cI personally think you may help\u2026or a hobby at least\u2026so you stop venting about my son and about his \u201cautism\u201d it\u2019s cringe, idk why he has autism tbh, that\u2019s why when he got older (5th grade) i put him in sub seperate classes because it\u2019s more gen ed and not a bunch of mentally incapable people\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl you are a dumpster fire. I\u2019m calling bs on you being nd: if you were \u201cND\u201d, you would realize that your my 21 yo (who is ND) may have a mom protecting his routine and hinting to shut it off, and he has asked me for help to read to help him understand your cues. i personally think you were tested with the wrong diagnosis as a kid, and your mom is protective of you because it\u2019s common in your hometown (the same city i live in) for young adults to be sheltered, or barely hangout/go out with friends. which is why i got pregnant as a teen with my 21 yo so i can have a normal life as an young adult.\u201d \n\nthe fact his mom said i\u2019m probably faking my autism is actually just fcked up tbh. it sounds ableist imo, when she has 3 ND sons (21,19,16).\n \nthen his mom said on tiktok from what my friend (20, his friend) told me, \u201cFor the triggered drama filled school people who are in this group. You really should try to educate someone that has autism, instead of letting them have free time during the day.  I don't need to be told about the various types of autism. It's called a spectrum for a reason. Because it varies \ud83d\ude44 I also have 3 sons who are ND, it\u2019s genetic from my husbands side of the family. he isn\u2019t ND. So if anyone is gonna come at me, at least make sense. this girl doesn\u2019t want advice on WHY her behaviour isn't okay (texting my son, venting about my son and his autism). she thinks she is ND because he is ND, but she is nowhere near ND, she doesn\u2019t understand why i checked his phone, that\u2019s NT behavior.\u201d \n\nthen his mom commented \u201cif anyone defends breanna, you\u2019re embarrassing yourselves fr. autism isn't an excuse to be venting on the internet about a stranger you met on snapchat. And please don't refer autism as a \"disability\", because i am not proud that my 21,19 and 16 yo are ND, but sadly they are and can\u2019t live like a NT person. Her behaviour isn't okay in many of her little vents and she needs to be held responsible for it.\u201d\n\nmy friend (20F,his friend) commented on his moms post because it was on her FYP saying \u201cwhy are you being rude to her over the fact your son really likes her. Life is hard as it is. You can be kind to her\u201d. then his mom said to my friend \u201ci have a feeling she is NT, and is faking to be ND to get with my son, She seems too function just fine. 21 is incapable of a lot of things. 19 and 16 are more higher functioning. 16 is in sub separate classes at the drama filled school. 19 and 21 were in sub separate classes in middle school. I don't like people that use autism as an excuse to vent on the internet. ffs,wow. can't have a conversation That says more about your intelligence and why you\u2019re a stoner \ud83d\udc4c I've reported you on tiktok for being a $lut, I don't engage with people who post $lutty things on tiktok. They aren't worth my time. Have a lovely rest of the night \ud83d\ude18\u201d. then my friend said to his mom \u201cAutism is literally a neurological developmental DISABILITY. Just because you or anyone else might not see it as one, doesn't mean that it's not an actual disability. You can't compare someone else, to your 3 sons because nobody is the same as someone else. Everyone handles things differently and she never said her autism is the excuse for anything. She was mentioning it to better explain to you jumping down her throat, why she does some of the things that she does. she was venting to her friends, it doesn't matter if it\u2019s \u201cdrama\u201d, she's 20 years old and almost all 20 year olds have constant drama going on in their lives. you apparently have a problem with her venting but yet take the time to tell her negative things & rude attitudes instead of just being a decent person. youre literally talking about how she's all drama and telling her to grow up and how she's childish/immature and a whole dictionary worth of things, are also causing more drama that she\u2019s  complaining about. It solves absolutely nothing and only makes her feel worse. Do yourself a favor and leave her alone, because she's allowed to be here despite what she vents.\u201d then his mom said to my friend,  \u201cimagine defending someone who\u2019s possibly a victim of munchausen by proxy and trying too tell them what they should think. Girl. Sit down. You are projecting your feelings and I honestly couldn't care less.\u201c then my friend said to his mom, \u201cNice straw man argument, miss girl. In case you\u2019re confused, comparing one person\u2019s truth to another\u2019s is in no way a valid point. To point out that 21,19 and 16 do or say \u2018such & such\u2019, therefore breanna should be able to do or say \u2018such & such\u2019 makes no sense. Furthermore, and forgive my wording if not proper in this instance, but the level of ND from one person to the next is wildly different. Surely you know this since you too are apparently on the \u201cspectrum\u201d. (Hint: refer to dictionary\u2019s definition of the word \u2018spectrum\u2019. Actually, I\u2019m curious why you sent messages to breanna through 21\u2019s account? My point is: who the h311 are you to assert that \u201cshe seems to function just fine\u201d? Not that I agree with this convaluted opinion, but YOU don\u2019t even appear to believe that judging by your comments\u2026 like you think he isn\u2019t capable to be on social media by the fact you check 21\u2019s phone. i\u2019m ND myself as you know, and my mom is strict herself but she wouldn\u2019t go on my phone and text people off my phone.\u201d \n\nthen my friend @ me and said \u201canyone with a lick of sense can see that 21\u2019s mom opinion is weird & convoluted. Not sure why she\u2019s so mad, but u have done absolutely nothing wrong. you are free to vent, i know 21\u2019s ex or whatever dmed you on tiktok.  Please girl, don\u2019t pay any mind to her or 21\u2019s ex or whatever. Their opinions aren\u2019t worth your energy. Clearly she is in need of some anger management.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cThis reads like Blah blah blah, I'm literally acting like a victim over being attacked by 21\u2019s mom, and getting messages by 21\u2019s mom through 21\u2019s phone.  Move on with your life. it's super unhealthy that you care so much about someone\u2019s mom texting you through their sons phone.  Trust me none of this will matter in 6 months. Especially not if you're stoned while posting this.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cdue to you being in a drama environment school as a teen, You need therapy. It sounds like you come from a very toxic family (due to where you grew up) and don't know how to form healthy bonds with the outside world, due to where you grew up. This will only get worse for you if you don't get some help, i know all this because i went to the same high school you did and most people there are unhinged and enjoy drama. which is why i sent my 21 and 19 yo to a vocational school because there\u2019s no drama there and it\u2019s a strict environment. Please put the effort into yourself to heal from your toxic upbringing.  And please for the love of the earth, do not date until you've gone to therapy for a whole year. I hope my 21 yo never runs into you, anyone like you (autistic,ND) or anyone you associate with. my 21 yo will never be dating anyone from that red flagged a$$ school that graduated there, ain\u2019t no fckin way. neither will my 19 and 16 yo, my 16 yo goes there so i\u2019m worried he\u2019ll end up dating someone from that trashy a$$ school. thankfully my 14 yo NT daughter knows better and is dating someone from a vocational school. my 13 yo NT son is a good kid so he prob don\u2019t even care about dating tbh, he\u2019s the most decent 13 yo in this generation.\u201d then his mom said \u201cthe reason why to get therapy is because your unhealthy mindset wouldn\u2019t be a thing in you.  Life is actually is much better after therapy.  Everything is easier. my 16 and 14 yo are in therapy due to them being decent people and not being saints due to the school they go to, and it\u2019s helped them realize they are better off talking to people and having friends from decent schools who know better, and show your vents about my son to your therapist when you go to therapy because that will help them so much in treating you.\u201c then his mom said \u201chow many times are you gonna vent about my son and what i do with him do you need to do, and be told to grow up. All you do is vent about my son to your friends and why did his mom take his phone and message me and it\u2019s childish bull \ud83d\udca9 and you know damn well why i texted you through his phone. you are a STRANGER to him and to me, idc what that grimey a$$ friend of his tells you, she is manipulating him into dating you because she thinks i\u2019ve arranged him to date that girl abigale told you about. the one that\u2019s insane is you, you\u2019re absolutely off your rocker and it\u2019s making me think you\u2019re psycho, my sister in law (maya) even told me you\u2019re psycho because you mentioned you were mad over the fact he spent the night at a girls house idc if she was a minor, yes she was a minor, but why does that matter, me and his father grew up with her family so it\u2019s okay\u201d. \n\nmy opinion: the fact this woman checks his phone, but allows him to go to a bar is just WILD to me.. and first off, it\u2019s not okay that he slept at a minors house. he\u2019s 21 she\u2019s 17. \n\nthen my friend commented back to his mom, \u201cgirl take your pick me self elsewhere. My statement obviously meant \u201cwe\u2019ve all had drama\u201d You\u2019re grown. Act it. She\u2019s 20. You\u2019re all attacking her. Only people that need to grow up is YOU.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cno I've never been there\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this isn't normal drama. this is trashy school drama that she complains so much because i went through 21\u2019s phone how dumb are you because you normalize drama for some reason how did you survive private school in high school like tell me because you must have gotten bullied so hard in high school \ud83e\udd23 she needs to get real help.\u201d then my friend said to his mom, \u201cyou are being nasty to this poor girl not keeping in mind that she still has so much to learn about herself, and so much growing to do. Think back on how you were at those ages and how you are now. Those are two different people. Stop jumping the gun and immediately attacking her. There\u2019s ways to talk to people. Imo you need to seek help on the way you speak to people. Nasty bitter person imo.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cIt's when she asks why she could possibly need therapy that makes me irritated. She doesn't want advice she wants to be told she's right and i\u2019m wrong for checking 21\u2019s phone when he\u2019s incapable to be on social media\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cYou constantly vent about my son, and don't want me offering you advice on how to seek help. Clearly 20 (my friend) is so naive and dumb to see how you actually are. You NEED help or else you will never be happy. i hope if you still are with my son in the future which you guys will end up getting a divorce and you\u2019ll probably be a single mother because you\u2019re such a unhappy person, my grandkids better not go to that trashy a$$ school thankfully my son will not let that happen because he wants his future kids to have a good education and go to a good school one day. just informing you that, but i know you won\u2019t be sticking around with my son for that long\u201d. then his mom said, \u201cbut, you asked my son why i texted you through his phone. how do you not see that you\u2019re the problem? you have proven that you aren\u2019t letting it go with how you are so confused as to why an adult man\u2019s mother is texting you through their sons phone\u201d. \n\nbut, didn\u2019t this mother again let her son stay the night with a 17 year old, let her son go to a BAR.. yeah he\u2019s old enough to drink, but like she gets in his personal life that\u2019s the weird part to me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cOk, you are the one bringing the fact that i took my sons phone to text you, so who's actually the problem here. Grow up\u201d. then his mom said \u201cYou need to grow up. geez. So much drama about how i went on my son\u2019s phone to text you and you are causing it. this is not the day of our lives \ud83d\ude12\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201clike i said, She's literally 20 years old and Autistic. I doubt you were even \"grown\" at 20 especially considering our frontal lobes aren't even fully formed until 25.\u201d then his mom said to my friend \u201ci was mature at 20, i had 21 at 17, and 19 when i was 19. i had 2 kids already when i was 20. you need to realize that she is causing drama when it isn't needed. It happened almost a week ago, yet she has re started it by venting about it. Also, you need to realize that she starts it all by the fact she texted 21 at 2am one night. I suggest she engage in a psychologist.\u201d \n\nthen his mom told me, \u201cyou need to take accountability for your actions, you messaged my son at 2am, i had the damn right to text you to leave, there was no need to text him at 2am, idc if you were asking what he was up to or if you saw he was active online. it\u2019s disgusting for someone to text the opposite seggs at 2am\u201d. \n\nhow\u2019s it disgusting that i was asking him how his night was going\u2026.\n\nthen his mom said, \u201cWhy are you so drama filled? i get you went to a school that has basically drama, you literally walk around thinking why did his mom contact me through  her sons phone, Who in their right mind texts someone at 2am... nobody but you. You need a hobby that doesn't involve the internet or unhinged friends.\u201d \n\nmy opinion: \u201cunhinged friends\u201d is just irrelevant because that\u2019s just wild she assumes how my friends are. \n\nthen his mom told me to stop venting about her son. \n\nthen his mom said to my friend \u201cchill out, and if you would realize she vents about my son and that she is drama for it you would be a decent person but no you seem to like drama and that\u2019s who breanna associates with is people who like drama\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cyou are the type of person who asks why do parents get involved in their sons life while they\u2019re dating or talking to me, it\u2019s because you texted my son at 2am.\u201d \n\nthen my friend responded to his mom \u201cask yourself why you care so much. Move on. You do realize, that when you say breanna is just looking for drama... and you are actively sitting here for like over an hour arguing with her is giving her drama, right? Unless you're the one looking for drama. None of your comments were necessary. Talking about this young GIRL being nothing but drama and yet your initial comment was specifically to START drama. Make it make sense \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \u201c\n\nthen his mom said to me \u201ctexting someone at 2am is harassment\u201d. i wasn\u2019t even doing anything except asking how his night was going. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou literally blame me for your actions, you\u2019re genuinely poor, 20 (my friend) defending you is so delulu of her\u2026\u201d \n\nthen my friend told his mom to leave me alone. then, my friend said to his mom \u201cDelulu? Because i\u2019m defending my friend who\u2019s a 20 year old autistic girl, No. The Delulu one would be you that seems to think it's necessary to just attack this girl because she is venting about how toxic you are. She's trying to vent her feelings in the best way that she knows. If anyone needs to grow up, it's YOU that get off on bullying people on the Internet. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\nthen, his mom is telling my friend \u201cso you think i should leave her alone? the fact you\u2019re saying i\u2019m being mean towards her is just actually fcked, what did i even do like i\u2019m being protective over 21 and want what\u2019s best for him and breanna is no role model for him! wow\u2026 the fact this is how drama filled school people go through life being told they are always right when she is blatantly inviting trouble, she texted 21 at 2am nobody is online or active at 2am except poor people. her \u2018autism\u2019 aside is just embarrassing autistics and poor people are just the most troubled people in this world, she truly is troubled and needs her help with her other personality disorders that she probably has but wasn\u2019t diagnosed because the city doesn\u2019t know how to be doctors and diagnose people with the right diagnosis, Its actually troubling and people believing she\u2019s autistic is actually just so wild it\u2019s how dumb they are. do you not realize she is antagonizing me? i\u2019m literally being a great parent. she has made lots of peoples lives so bad and traumatized them\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201cthe fact you had to spread false information about her is just so wild\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen my friend told me \u201cshe\u2019s dumb as h*ll \ud83d\ude2d Like, hating on you for your feelings.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cI lost braincells. You definitely need a different hobby because you constantly vent about my son and how i went on his phone to text you. you are the problem. you\u2019re so senseless\u201d. then his mom said \u201cur victimizing yourself over me texting you through my sons phone. stop chasing after my son\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cYou are exhausting. U need to grow up and stop being childish imagine what you\u2019re gonna be like in a few years, god damn you\u2019re bonkers. you need help. you\u2019re absolute childish for what you did. texting someone at 2am is sick asf it gives stalker vibes. you don\u2019t get the fact you need therapy and the fact you asked why you need it is actually embarrassing. you will be in a healthy place mentally if you were to go to therapy.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Hi, so every now and then I see a post on here about from a young person asking if they should share to their family/parents that they\u2019re non religious and I just want to share my personal experience since when I was 15, I did the same thing.\n\nFor some context, my parents were pastors. I was adopted from the country they did missionary work in. I was homeschooled (which is an entirely different conversation). So Christianity was their life. I ended up leaving it because I literally couldn\u2019t do anything. Couldn\u2019t watch certain movies, listen to certain music, have different opinions, express myself in certain ways. It just wasn\u2019t for me. I did have a bit of an edgy atheist phase but outside of making a public post about it on my social media, I wasn\u2019t debating. Because I don\u2019t care what anybody who isn\u2019t me believes\n\nMy relationship with my parents changed when I told them. I mean, I guess I should\u2019ve known it would happen. But I think that my teenage nativity and own personal feelings of it not being that deep clouded my judgment. After I told them, I can only really describe that I faced a lot of isolation, casual cruelty, and strong arming of me to stay silent. I was constantly pressured to become Christian again (even though I went to church for a few years after I stopped believing it just for their sake) and I was constantly insulted. They even prayed with me for god to stop \u201cprotecting me\u201d.  The entire event showed me Christian\u2019s true colors and I think that if they had just been nice and understanding, I would\u2019ve converted back. But I\u2019m not the type of person who you can \u201ctreat wrong\u201d into being a Christian again.\n\nThey became really hands off. I realized very early on that they were trying to make my life suck and try to get me to crawl back to their belief system. I think that they were trying to freeze me out or something, but it didn\u2019t work. I would say that they did soft forms of neglect. They were never good at emotional, or mental, nurturing me but they really stopped caring after I left the faith. I was going through a \u201crebellious\u201d teenage (aka I liked hard rock music and was depressed because of untreated academic issues and my traumas being neglected) phase. I wasn\u2019t a wild teenager. I just wanted to be normal and included in society, not insular Christian communities.\n\nI don\u2019t bring up my beliefs, or theirs. I\u2019m very respectful. I don\u2019t want to change them, but they\u2019re hellbent on changing me even to this today.  It\u2019s been 10 years of this. It\u2019s off and on but it always comes up. Over a decade of being berated, othered, and pressured. They can\u2019t comprehend that what they\u2019re doing is wrong. Don\u2019t ever bring up life or mental health to them either because that\u2019s asking for them to try to re-convert you.\n\nTo close this out, to anybody who wants to share that they\u2019re deconverted understand that you\u2019re paying a price. They will NEVER stop. Even if you set a \u201cno talking about religious beliefs\u201d boundary, they won\u2019t care. They will degrade you. Make you feel like less of a member of the family. Hell, even use soft forms of neglect while they treat your siblings better. They will take stuff away. The church members will become more family than you are. They will call you \u201churt\u201d, say \u201cyou hate god\u201d, bring up a thing sensitive to you and use that against you. \n\nIf a Christian can\u2019t love you into re-converting, they\u2019ll try to hurt you into re-converting. \n\nMy advice: lie and use them until you can separate and then tell them. I know it\u2019s soul destroying but they\u2019re too trusting of other Christian. Play the stupid christian social games, it\u2019s not hard to wrap these people around your finger. Your Christian parents will gladly hurt you and set your life back for god. Had I just lied and played good Christian, I know I\u2019d be in a better place in life because they will give you crumbs if you tell them you\u2019re not the same religion as them anymore. If I were to lie and fake convert now, they\u2019d treat me way better and care more about me. However, I haven\u2019t gone through a decade of BS just to fold. ",

        "selftext": "Reflective essays are often handed out to students, as assignments, after they complete an important project. Or if they are younger students, like in high school or middle school, then probably after they are back from a vacation or an important school trip. In this article, we will explore what a reflective essay is and also some reflective essay writing tips, that may help you to write one of your own. Combine these with your writing skills, and you have the recipe for a perfect reflective essay!\n\nWhat is a Reflective Essay\n\nLet's begin with the basics. What exactly is a reflective essay? A reflective essay is that form of essay writing which makes the writer think and 'reflect' on his experience pertaining to the topic that has been given to him or her. It does not involve too much research as the crux of this type of essay is to write exactly what you feel about a certain topic or issue. As opposed to persuasive essay topics, which require you to study a topic in depth, you may need to have just very basic knowledge of the facts and figures related to the topic you're going to be writing about. But that is one of the most initial phases of reflective essay writing. Since the essay involves personal experience, you'll definitely have, at least, the rudimentary knowledge about the topic. Generally, reflective essays are used as an assessment mechanism, for both, students, as well as the teachers, and sometimes even the administration. So, the next time you are asked to write a reflective essay, you know that you must voice your opinions, no matter how bizarre they might seem to others. It is your platform to express your views. And that is the basic point of writing a reflective essay after all.\n\nHow to Write an Effective Reflective Essay\n\nIn this section of the article, we will give you some tips for writing a good reflective essay. They will give you an idea of what exactly the essay outline format and structure should be. So read the reflective essay writing tips given below, and get ready to write one yourself.\n\nFormat and Structure\n\nA reflective essay is different from any other form of essay writing only in its content. Otherwise, it follows the same basic format and structure of introduction, body and conclusion. Here, we will see what exactly you should write in the introduction, body and conclusion, respectively.\n\nIntroduction: Just like any other essay, the introduction of a reflective essay, too, is the most important part of the essay. It is on the basis of this, that the reader will decide if he or she should go ahead and read the entire essay. In the introduction, you must state the topic you're going to write on and the reason you're writing on it. Also, very subtly, you can mention the slant or stand that you will be taking on that topic.\n\nBody: Again very similar to any other essay, the body is where you go deep into the topic. In case of reflective essays, you dig deep into yourself, explore your emotions and write about everything that you felt when the incident or event was taking place. For instance, if you're writing about an art exhibit that you arranged for your school or college, you can start by writing about how you wanted to be a part of the team and how you felt when your name was announced as a member of the team to arrange the event. Then you can go on about all the small incidents, arguments, jokes, troubles, deadlines, etc. that were all a part of the whole co-ordination. Take each point, dissect it meticulously, and write about how each point made you feel. If you think you could have done better or that you could have been helped better, mention that too. The key is, to be absolutely honest and clear about whatever you're writing. There's absolutely no other way of writing a reflective essay.\n\nConclusion: In the conclusion, just like any other essay (again!), summarize the entire essay and very briefly mention the slant or stance that you've taken on the topic. Keep your conclusion strong worded, so as to ensure maximum and prolonged retention by the reader.\n\nOne of the best reflective essay writing tips that can be given is to keep the language simple, and the content, honest and true. Faking an opinion or an emotion is the worst way to write it, because it will definitely be detected and that will create an unfavorable impression in the mind of the reader. This can prove to be detrimental, so be cautious and be honest! Use these tips for writing essays and you'll definitely do well!",

        "selftext": " ***Tl;dr:***  *Someone posted a* [*threatening letter*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1bl0vo7/update_bad_gym_behavior_sending_letters_to_other/) *supposedly from Deborah Gracie of Gracie Sports Fairfield to Joe Oppedisano of Fit Club bjj on Friday.  We took it down to check it out but now it will be reinstated. The gym owner (by phone) says the letter is real, but is nearly a year old, and that he did not post this content here because he does not want to get involved in social media drama. Others (likely former student of Joe\u2019s or Deborah's) may be stoking this drama online.  While this issue has enough credibility for us to leave the post up, please don\u2019t go taking advantage of other people\u2019s troubles for your own gain on the internet. Report any more posts on this topic, please.*\n\nFuck, even the tl;dr is over 100 words\u2026..\n\nSo this weekend we had quite the drama on r/bjj, [with a threatening letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1bl0vo7/update_bad_gym_behavior_sending_letters_to_other/) supposedly sent from one gym owner to another in Connecticut.  Here is a rough timeline:\n\n1. User A (a basically brand-new account) attempted to post an image of the threatening letter. This post was caught by automod and the user was told not to post it.\n2. User B (an older account, but with little to no post history) re-posted the letter, and automod did not filter it. By the time mods saw the post it had very quickly amassed hundreds of upvotes and comments.\n3. User C (another older account, little/no post history) posted a few \"update\" threads, attacking the head coral belt instructor at the academy the threatening letter supposedly came from.\n4. Posts were left remaining due to the engagement they already had, and users were warned not to brigade.\n5. Complaints of slander began rolling in, to both modmail and DMs to mods.\n6. Mods began investigating the source of the letter as well as its recipient.\n7. After [reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1bl0vo7/comment/kw3r6c3/), researching, and [speaking privately](https://imgur.com/a/Da45sLQ) with a few individuals, mods were able to ascertain that the recipient of the letter was Joe Oppedisano of Fit Club BJJ in Fairfield, CT.\n\nMods reached out to Joe and spoke with him on the phone to gather more information about the letter, its source, and the story behind it. Here are the details from Joe:\n\n* **Joe says the letter was absolutely received by him, but it was almost a year ago.**  Based on this, we don\u2019t believe the idea that by leaving the letter up, we are spreading fake news.  An actual person has now alleged this is real, and at this point the letter seems credible enough to leave posted on the subreddit.\n* **Joe says he did not post the letter or any of the posts here, and DOES NOT APPROVE OF ANYONE DOING SO OR GOING AFTER GRACIE SPORTS ON SOCIALS.**  A gym member notified him this was going on, and this is how he learned of r/bjj. They have been trying to get to the bottom of who posted this since Friday.  There\u2019s a guy at his gym who posted a fake review about Deborah\u2019s gym and was kicked out of Fit Club a few months back.  Deborah\u2019s gym also kicked out 2 people who Joe believes may have had access to the letter and could be stirring up the drama between the two camps. Joe doesn\u2019t do social, so on his behalf, **if you are one of the people posting this content PLEASE STOP.** Joe has had to speak to all of his students about not sharing the drama around on social. Mods will be putting a moratorium on posts about this to support it.   Doing something like this on behalf of another person without their permission is never a good idea. Please report any more content on this.\n* **Joe says there\u2019s been loads of other stuff too.** This includes physical intimidation and threats, letters sent to at least one other person that he\u2019s heard of, and other things.  He has kept receipts. We have enough receipts of our own that we are comfortable reinstating the thread about the letter.\n\nThis is about all we can do at this point. We cannot determine the source of the posts, but a real person is willing to claim the letter is real. \n\n**What can** r/bjj **learn from this?**\n\n* **Be honest.**  If you are poking around our spam filter, using multiple accounts to post content on the same subject, playing the \u201cstay tuned for my next post about this exact same topic\u201d game, you are muddying the waters, and you are giving opportunity for the other party to claim all manner of victimhood to such an extent that you ruin your own case and risk your reddit account. We spoke to one of the account holders who said he\u2019s a different person from the others.  We still cannot confirm or disagree with that at the moment.\n* **Represent** ***yourself*****.** This clearly sounds like a case where someone is trying to act on Joe and Deborah\u2019s situation for their own gain.   If you are not a person directly involved with an issue and plan to name names, talk to them before posting here.\n* **Our name and shame policy is important to the community, but it needs your protection.** BJJ unfortunately has its share of shoddy owners, weirdos and unsafe places.  We feel it is a large community\u2019s duty to allow the highlighting of these places for people\u2019s betterment and wellbeing.  But if it is abused, we\u2019ll have to rethink it.  As it is, mods will have to put their heads together to figure out how to handle these things going forward.  \n\n**If you\u2019re someone who is involved and agrees / disagrees with Joe\u2019s content said here:**\n\n* **Use the comments in this thread.**  We\u2019ve heard from people who believe there is more to the story, which we cannot verify, but to be honest, this is where this letter thing ends on reddit.  No more new posts.  If you\u2019re with Deborah\u2019s team, please go to Joe and his crew directly. We suggested this weekend you make your own post to discuss your side of things, but since that hasn\u2019t happened, we really need to be done with this drama now.  \n* **Modmail and DMs from people upset about the letter post will no longer be accepted.** You\u2019ve asked us to review, and we have.  Note also that *only* the letter post will be reinstated.  After deep review we agree notionally that the video posts, while strictly would be allowed under normal circumstances, were being used to throw gasoline on the fire and they will remain removed.  We are also working with admins to investigate the users who posted the content.\n* **Takedown requests should be sent directly to admins.**  We\u2019ve made our call, have been in touch with admins and will keep them updated.   Remember that if your beef is with anybody, it is not reddit.  We leave up information whose veracity seems reasonable, and in this case after talking with Joe, we think that is in fact the case.\n\nOkay, round\u2019s over.  Get some water and partner back up.",

In the aftermath, the upheaval caused by Wayne\u2019s death would have allowed Luthor to both regain control of his own holdings and make strides toward taking over WayneTech in its entirety; a legitimate and proportional response, in his personal view.\n\nThe way he saw things, he had three potential courses of action to draw upon.\n\nThe first was to flee, go underground, abandon everything he\u2019d ever worked on, and pop up later under a different identity to start fresh. That he\u2019d *succeed* in such an endeavour, he had no doubt, but it felt far too much like admitting defeat \u2026  because it basically *was.*\n\nLex Luthor did *not* admit defeat. That wasn\u2019t who he was.\n\nThe second was to hand himself in to the authorities for the attack on Wayne, plead diminished responsibility, and let his high-powered lawyers browbeat the prosecution into giving him a mere slap on the wrist. Thus free and clear, he would be able to set about regaining control of LexCorp without having to worry about police or heroes tracking him down.\n\nHe disliked that option, too. It felt far too much like throwing himself on the mercy of his enemies, and he was not in favour of any gamble where he didn\u2019t have control of all the variables. With the utter shambles Wayne had made of his finances, he would be hard put to get access to more than half a million dollars, and his lawyers were mercenary enough that they would drop him flat the moment that money ran out. No amount of promising a big payout once he regained access to his full cash reserves would work on them. He knew that because it wouldn\u2019t work on him, and he\u2019d made a practice of retaining lawyers who thought like he did. Otherwise, what was the point?\n\nWorse, even if Luthor did manage to scrape by with a minimal punishment in a criminal trial, Wayne would be entirely free to tie him up in civil suits until the heat death of the universe. With his own resources as yet untouched, Wayne could force extortionate payouts, draining any remaining money Luthor had right into the WayneTech coffers.\n\nNo: while the law was a useful tool for bludgeoning morons who didn\u2019t know any better, or who he didn\u2019t have any other leverage over, he had no taste for being the subject of such treatment.\n\nThe third option, therefore, was the most appropriate; also, the most palatable one for him. He would go on the attack, and destroy Wayne physically. Once he\u2019d done this, and regained his rightful property, then the authorities could attempt to persecute him all they liked. Absent their star witness, and with access to his money to fuel an endless minefield of legal traps in his defence, he would be able to drag the case out until the prosecution collapsed from sheer exhaustion.\n\nAnd if Wayne attempted to use his little private army of metahumans? Luthor had done his research on all of them, and not one was untouchable, not even the alien from Krypton. If they moved against him, he would obliterate them. And even if they didn\u2019t, he\u2019d probably find it needful to destroy them anyway, sooner or later.\n\nAll of life was a power struggle; Luthor specialised in taking on those who thought themselves better than him, and proving them wrong.\n\nHowever, as much as he wanted to be the one to lead the assault on Wayne Manor (and to spit in Wayne\u2019s face before putting a bullet between his eyes) he had other tasks to accomplish. These necessitated that he travel to Metropolis and gain entry to the LexCorp building before they finished investigating it and finding out all his secrets. Used intelligently, the dirt he held in the max-security vault concealed in his office could be used to overturn any case against him.\n\nHe had little concern about someone else gaining entry to the vault itself. His entire office was lined with lead, so certain prying eyes couldn\u2019t simply peruse the contents, or even determine the existence of the vault. It had been constructed to his personal specifications, utilising the most durable alloys and stringent security precautions in existence. Along with this, it possessed a failsafe that would spray the interior of the vault with a mixture of dioxygen difluoride and chlorine trifluoride, destroying all its contents (along with everything else in the office) if the door was forced open. Just in case it was the Man of so-called Steel doing the forcing, another mechanism would send kryptonite dust into the air at the same time, so that he would lose his vaunted powers shortly before being incinerated by one of the most destructive chemical reactions known to mankind.\n\nThose who had constructed and installed the vault had, of course, died in totally random accidents mere weeks later, and all relevant records destroyed in an equally random fire. Luthor didn\u2019t consider himself overly paranoid. He occasionally wondered if he was paranoid *enough.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Later That Night**\n\nAlthough Metropolis was bigger than Gotham, the garbage removal services actually *worked*, and weren\u2019t riddled with corruption from top to bottom. Standing half-concealed in an alleyway where he could see the LexCorp building\u2014he\u2019d constructed it with his own hands, metaphorically if not literally, and he would burn it all down before he let some idealistic rich kid take it all away from him\u2014Luthor could barely see any trash at all. He took the burner phone from his pocket and dialled a number from memory.\n\nIt rang twice, then was answered. \u201c*Joe\u2019s pool service. Can I help you?*\u201d\n\nThis was another layer of security, of course. If anyone was listening in, the conversation had to sound innocuous. \u201cYes. I have a pool severely in need of cleaning. The algae in particular is getting out of hand.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Sounds bad. Do you want me to come out straight away?\u201d*\n\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d He gave the address of a house in Gotham that indeed had a pool. Whether it needed cleaning, he had no idea. The man he was talking to wouldn\u2019t care, because he wasn\u2019t going there. \u201cAs soon as possible would be good.\u201d\n\n*\u201cWe\u2019re on our way.*\u201d\n\nHe ended the call, knowing that the arrangements he\u2019d made before leaving Gotham would bear fruit soon. No fewer than twelve men, whom he had briefed extensively about Wayne Manor and how to defeat any of the metahumans they were likely to encounter, would be converging on Wayne Manor right now. Once inside, they were to remove any and all witnesses and destroy whatever computer systems they found before torching the place. If they could subdue Wayne and get him away alive, they were to do so; otherwise, he had to die.\n\nBefore leaving Gotham, Luthor had taken a driving route that had gotten him within visual range of Wayne Manor, and noticed that the stately edifice was now surrounded by a transparent green bubble. It seemed like at least one of the freaks was sticking by Wayne, and by inference he had confirmation as to where Wayne himself was cowering. Luthor didn\u2019t have to exert his brain in the slightest to know which of them had created that effect.\n\nIn Luthor\u2019s understanding, the Green Lanterns were an interstellar police force; sooner or later, he was going to have to explain to this one that he\u2019d be better off doing his policing elsewhere. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Luthor had had to deliver that message, nor was it likely to be the last.\n\nGetting back to the task at hand, he couldn\u2019t just walk in through the front doors of the LexCorp building with impunity. At the very least, he would be stopped by security. If they recognised him through his current disguise and Wayne had gotten to them (which Luthor was certain he would have) then he would be arrested and handed over to the authorities.\n\nFortunately, he possessed other avenues of entry. Having personally overseen the construction of the building came with *some* perks. Among his personal items (which Wayne hadn\u2019t confiscated, an oversight that would cost his adversary dearly) was a LexCorp credit card with a secret chip embedded in it. This would allow it to be used as a swipe card, but not for the front door. Or even the rear exit.\n\nMoving back down the alley, he checked for unwanted watchers\u2014even upward\u2014before levering up a manhole and climbing down into the sewer system. At the bottom, he paused and listened for a moment before moving the few steps to an innocuous electrical junction box. The door opened easily enough, and he used the card to tap against what looked like a perfectly normal electrical component. The concealed reader beeped agreeably, and a section of wall alongside the junction box recessed inward then slid aside with a gentle rumble.\n\nHe closed the junction box and stepped into the tunnel, then used his card on a reader inside to close the secret entrance. Lights came on, shining just brightly enough to show him the way.\n\nDespite the itch between his shoulder-blades, Luthor knew he wasn\u2019t being observed from on high. Mainly because there had been changes in the time since the alien had shown up on the scene: every street, sidewalk, traffic island and alleyway within three blocks of the LexCorp building had been upgraded out of his own pocket \u2026 and every new slab of concrete had enough lead particles in it to severely degrade the interloper\u2019s X-ray vision. The same went for the fa\u00e7ade of the LexCorp building, and every interior wall therein.\n\nHe moved faster now, knowing that the sooner he had this over and done with, the sooner he could get back to Gotham and commence his takeover of Wayne\u2019s business holdings. There would need to be a company-wide restructuring and a reassessment of priorities once he had them in hand, of course. The \u2018Wayne Projects\u2019 and \u2018A Better Tomorrow\u2019 sectors would work much better, in his opinion, once they\u2019d been readjusted for maximum profit.\n\nMeanwhile, the stupid circus that Wayne funded would be shut down and the animals sold off to whatever zoos would take them as soon as he could manage it. Sentiment had a place, but business wasn\u2019t it.\n\nWhen he reached the steel door at the end of the tunnel, the reader panel beside it lit up. He wiped his hand carefully on his shirt, laid it on the panel, and solemnly recited the phrase, \u201cOpen sesame.\u201d Between his voice print and his handprint, the mechanism recognised him, allowing the door to slide aside.\n\nOn the other side was a high-speed elevator that had been built into the core of one of the building\u2019s sixteen support pillars. The elevator was designed to go from his office to this bolt-hole and back again, and that was it. Stepping inside, he removed the fake glasses and looked into the retina scanner; after the laser swept over his eye, the reader beeped and the door closed. The elevator began to move upward, smoothly and swiftly.\n\nAlso inside the elevator was a set of Wayne Security body armour that he\u2019d had acquired to determine what its weak points were. The intent had been to figure out where Wayne had cut corners, then improve on it for his own benefit. He hadn\u2019t actually been able to find any way to upgrade it in a profitable way, so he\u2019d had it repainted in urban camo and stashed it in the elevator; if he was fleeing for his life, he reasoned, high-end body armour was something he would most likely have an urgent need for.\n\nBy the time he\u2019d finished donning it, the elevator had reached the level of his office. However, he didn\u2019t press the button to open the door immediately. First, he pressed a button on his watch (he\u2019d left the gloves off for this reason), synchronising it with the security systems in his office. One of these systems was a scanner that would alert him to any human body warmth within the room.\n\nIt seemed to take an inordinate amount of time for the telltale to show up a cheery green, indicating that there were no significant heat sources to worry about. The next thing he did was remotely activate the electronic locking mechanism on the office doors. Even if security noticed his presence somehow, they would have to break through those doors, which were steel-cored and had bulletproof casings on the locks. Finally, he pressed the button; the door slid open, along with a section of wood panelling, and he stepped into his office.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t see many details, and couldn\u2019t risk turning on a light\u2014while Superman\u2019s X-ray vision might not be able to penetrate leaded glass, the alien would certainly be able to see lit-up drapes\u2014but that didn\u2019t matter. He knew every inch of the office, so he went straight to the section of wall between the Rembrandt and the Vermeer\u2014originals both\u2014and laid his hands over what looked like a pair of knots in the mahogany panelling. With a click and a whir, the paired readers picked up the bioelectrical signature through the paper-thin veneer, registered that it was him, and opened the way to the vault.\n\nWithin the recess thus exposed, tiny LEDs sprang to life, barely illuminating the panel before him. There was always the chance that someone else would find the rigged panels and open them, so there was still more security to get through. However, this wasn\u2019t merely some basic combination that could be teased out through trickery; he\u2019d put *thought* into this.\n\nThe first lock was indeed a numerical combination, but it wasn\u2019t a simple sequence to be memorised. Pressing another button on his watch, he waited until it popped up a number on the dial. The combination he had to enter wasn\u2019t the number on the watch: it was the cube of that number, changing every thirty seconds. His lips moved briefly as he calculated the total in his head, then he rapidly typed the answer in.\n\nThe panel emitted the triple-beep that indicated success, then slid aside to make way for the next one. This involved a microphone and a retinal scanner; while looking into the scanner, he recited the mantra, \u201cMy name is Alexander Joseph Luthor, and I cannot be beaten.\u201d At the same time, he blinked his eyelids in Morse code, spelling out his name.\n\nWith the second security challenge complete, he allowed the panel to slide aside. Behind it was a simple turn-wheel, though even that had readers built into the bars. If it detected elevated levels of stress, it would lock the whole thing down. For this reason, Luthor kept his breathing steady and his heartbeat under control with a simple biofeedback routine.\n\nOnce he had what he wanted from the vault, he would contact his men. If they\u2019d succeeded, he would close the vault again. If by some fluke of fate they had failed, he would trigger a timed destruct, releasing the dioxygen difluoride and chlorine trifluoride as well as setting off explosives. It would not go off until he was well away, giving him a useful distraction for getting back to Gotham. The building would burn hotter than anything else on Earth while it lasted. Even Superman\u2019s vaunted freezing breath would not serve to quench those flames. *I built this place, and I can destroy it.*\n\nThe wheel turned all the way clockwise twice, then came to a halt with a *clunk.* Drawing a deep breath, he gripped the wheel and pulled. The door separated from the seal with a slow sucking sound, then gradually swung open.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**The Outskirts of Gotham City**\n\nEven as the van coasted to a stop outside the wall that surrounded the Wayne estate, the huge green bubble that covered the manor itself could be seen in the distance. Jack Kerrigan grinned briefly, but nobody could tell the difference between that and his normal expression. Breaking into some rich fat-cat\u2019s home, breaking his shit, and wrecking his whole day? This was gonna be *fun.*\n\nLex Luthor had had Jack broken out of prison, along with the other eleven men in his contingent, so that they could perform acts of deniable violence on his behalf. Jack was just fine with this. Ever since his face had been slashed in prison, he\u2019d had trouble seeing the funny side of things anymore, even the jokes he used to tell. Passing on the pain to others was much more preferable for him, these days.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t kidding about the \u2018algae\u2019,\u201d one of the others quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s about as green as it gets.\u201d\n\nJack reached out and slapped him upside the head. \u201cShut the fuck up. No joking around. This shit\u2019s serious. Now, everyone\u2019s got their yellow suit on?\u201d\n\nThis time, there were nods all around. Underneath their dark outer clothing, everyone wore a one-piece yellow coverall. Furthermore, they had yellow balaclavas, yellow tinted goggles, yellow gloves and yellow booties in their pockets. Luthor had been extremely specific on this point. Nobody wanted to be the asshole who got caught by Green Lantern because they\u2019d screwed up.\n\nJack went on down the list of counters: each of them had a tiny chunk of glowing green rock in a capsule around his neck, as well as high-end blowtorches that could shoot flame out a couple of feet. To beat the star-spangled bitch, every second man had a net-thrower, which Luthor was *fairly* sure would count as \u2018being bound by a man\u2019. For the Flash they had a panic button which would start shrilling out a warbling scream in a frequency they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear but which Luthor had assured them would mess with the speedster\u2019s inner ears.\n\nAs for Wayne himself, or the butler, no special precautions were needed. Jack and his crew were being paid good money to make them stop being a problem for Lex Luthor, so that was what would happen. The fact that they\u2019d been told they could keep any trinkets they pocketed along the way was just the gravy on top.\n\nOne by one, they exited the van. The wall was a good eight feet high, but Luthor had supplied them with collapsible aluminum ladders, which allowed them to go up and over with relative ease. On the far side of the wall was a broad expanse of neatly trimmed grass, interspersed with topiary bushes and taller trees; fortunately, there were none of the telltale signs of electric eye beams or laser fences. Luthor had assured them that there was no such security outside the house, but Jack preferred to make sure of such things for himself.\n\nThey converged on the green bubble around the house, ducking from shadow to shadow to avoid being spotted from the main building. Once they got up to it, Jack put out his hand and pressed on it. It held firm, and he nodded. \u201cOkay, yellow up.\u201d\n\nIt felt a little stupid to be dressing all in yellow from head to toe, but Jack knew damn well that nobody was going to be making any stupid jokes about it. He knew it because *they* knew he\u2019d shoot them in the face if they did. And once they found Green Lantern and beat the shit out of him, they could dress normally again.\n\nAs soon as everyone was properly sorted out, Jack pressed his now yellow-gloved hand against the glowing green barrier. It melted away before him like snow in front of a flamethrower, and he walked forward into the gap thus created. The first obstacle thus overcome, they continued their advance toward Wayne Manor.\n\nThe next obstacle was how to gain access to the building proper. The front door was right there, but Jack had an idea that they might be waiting for everyone to come in by the same way. He held up his hand and everyone stopped, then considered his options.\n\n\u201cSo what are we doing?\u201d asked Gagsworthy, one of the idiots who kept trying to make jokes. If he wasn\u2019t careful, Jack would end up making an example out of him. \u201cJumping down the chimney?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cWe\u2019re splitting up into pairs and going in by different ways. You see spandex, lock \u2019em down until we\u2019re done. The old butler, tie him up or something. Wayne, beat the snot out of him and bring him to me. Got it?\u201d The tone of his voice told them that they\u2019d better get it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOn an upper floor, Superman turned to J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz. \u201cIs it just me, or do none of them look like Luthor under their masks?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of them are,\u201d the Martian agreed, hovering cross-legged over the floor. \u201cNor do they have any idea where he is or what he might be doing. I will tell Mr Wayne this.\u201d\n\n{{Bruce,}} he transmitted mentally. {{We have twelve thugs approaching the house from different directions, but none of them is Luthor. Nor do they know where he is. Do you want us to apprehend them?}}\n\n((I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t,)) Bruce replied. ((If he\u2019s watching from a distance, or monitoring them over a radio link, I don\u2019t want him to know what happens to them. You and Superman keep watch for Luthor himself, just in case this is a feint. We can handle the physical stuff.))\n\n{{You are, as they say, the boss.}}\n\n\\[[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/l8e19b/pi_without_the_bat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\] \\[[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/15e0y7n/oc_without_the_bat_part_13_close_to_home/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\] \\[Next\\]",

        "selftext": "**The Early Clarity:** Dylan\u2019s initial offerings to the world were smooth, clear, devoid of the rough edges he\u2019d later be celebrated for. This starting point alone begs the question of how we ended up where we did. Listen to the pre-fame Dylan: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AkWyi6MoeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AkWyi6MoeY)\n\n* **The Harry Smith Influence:** It's widely acknowledged that Dylan had his ears deep in the Harry Smith Anthology of American Folk Music. This treasure trove of folk history undeniably shaped his musical landscape. But when you listen to \"Henry Lee,\" a haunting ballad from the anthology, the mimicry in Dylan\u2019s later \"authentic\" voice becomes apparent. \"Henry Lee\" lays bare the blueprint: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk6ZC1b0oRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk6ZC1b0oRw)\n* **Adopting the Scratch:** The transition to a scratchy, nasally voice marked Dylan's rise as a folk icon. This voice, however, strikes me as a carefully constructed mask, not the authentic evolution of a singer\u2019s voice but a deliberate choice, influenced heavily by his exposure to and fascination with the raw, unpolished voices of the past. The celebrated \"Dylan\" sound: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgphPFNiVZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgphPFNiVZw)\n* **Questionable Permanence:** The narrative that smoking irreparably altered his voice falls flat when you consider Dylan\u2019s occasional return to smoother vocalizations in later performances. This inconsistency undercuts the argument of a natural, unavoidable change. Dylan, back to smoother tones: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhzEsb2tNbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhzEsb2tNbI)\n* **Mitchell\u2019s Accusation:** Joni Mitchell\u2019s accusation of Dylan not being \"authentic at all\" but a \"plagiarist\" with a \"fake\" voice and name might sound harsh, but it\u2019s a critical piece of this puzzle. If Dylan\u2019s scratchy voice was indeed a studied affectation, inspired by songs like \"Henry Lee,\" then what part of his folk persona was genuinely his?\n\nIn essence, Dylan\u2019s scratchy voice, lauded for its authenticity, seems more an inauthentic construct\u2014a persona crafted for the stage, drawing heavily from the wells of tradition he admired, rather than an organic outgrowth of his own vocal journey. The evidence? His fluctuating vocal style, the origins of his influences, and the very essence of his transformation all point to a meticulously designed character rather than a naturally evolved artist.\n\n**Let\u2019s Discuss:** Is the \"authentic\" Dylan voice a masterful creation, inspired by the likes of \"Henry Lee\" and the folk archives he revered? Does this revelation diminish his legacy, or does it underscore the genius of his artistry in crafting such a compelling and influential persona?\n\nPersonally I am critical of Dylan as he is often praised for being authentic but it seems like he is just putting on a persona and not showing his true self",

When the civil war broke out, he fled for fear of his life. That was in 2014 and his journey took him to Germany via Lebanon, Iran and T\u00fcrkiye, M\u00fcnchner Merkur and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung are writing in a portrait. Now he is a integration and migration helper at Caritas and counsels refugees. In addition to that he is one of the candidates in the European election for Volt Deutschland. He wants to \u201cgive a voice to those who don't have one and, above all, \\[\u2026\\] to actively shape politics, not just advise them.\u201d His main focus at European level is \"a more humane asylum policy\u201d, because the \u201ccurrent asylum reform violates human rights and is very inhumane\u201d. He wants to show \"how strong Europe can be together\".\n\n*Italy* *-* Volt prepares for the regional elections in Basilicata on April 21/22th, writes TRM. Regional coordinator Eustachio Follia is one of the presidential candidates. Eustachio leads the movement, which aims in particular to counter depopulation and enhance local resources to generate development and opportunities, especially for young people. The group intends to offer an alternative strategy to the traditional political divide, aiming to restore 'trust and value' to the Lucanian community through a 'good politics' approach.\n\n*Portugal* *-* In an article for Postal secretary-general of Volt Portugal Yannick Schade talks about how he got into politics and the low voter turnout in Portugal. \u201cWe all need an EU that works better, that is able to protect our rights and improve our lives, and I believe that we all need to get involved in politics to achieve this. We need a stronger, more democratic EU that is a power in the world, so that it has a positive impact on the continent and the world\u201d, Yannick emphasises.\n\n*Belgium* *-* After the European Parliament approved a new European media law to ensure the independence of the media, Sophie in 't Veld, MEP, lead candidate at the European elections for Volt Belgium and member of the European Parliament's Pegasus Committee of Inquiry, criticised Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n for the historic low in EU relations under his government, including the rule of law case, reports RTL in Hungary. Sophie asks if \"we really have to accept that all the work we put into \\[EU-\\]accession \\[in 2004\\] was in vain? - \"No, we cannot accept that\u201d, she concludes and believes things will get better in a Hungary after Orban.",

        "selftext": "The 313000a159 paper titled \"A Representative Study on Human Detection of Artificially Generated Media Across Countries\" makes the following main contributions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Conducting the first preregistered cross-country and cross-media survey on people's ability to detect AI-generated media, spanning three countries (USA, Germany, and China) with 3,002 participants covering audio, image, and text media.\n\n2. Providing evidence that state-of-the-art AI-generated media is almost indistinguishable from \"real\" media, with the majority of participants simply guessing when asked to rate them as human- or machine-generated.\n\n3. Identifying that generalized trust, cognitive reflection, and self-reported familiarity with deepfakes significantly influence participants' decisions across all media categories through a regression analysis.\n\n4. Revealing several other influential factors that affect the ability to detect AI-generated media, dependent on the media type, such as holistic thinking, political orientation, and media literacy subscales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrengths:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Large sample size of 3,002 participants across three countries, increasing the generalizability of the results.\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive analysis of various personal variables and their influence on the ability to detect AI-generated media, providing insights into potential factors that could improve or worsen detection.\n\n\u2022 Preregistration of the study design and analysis plan, enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of the research.\n\n\u2022 Cross-media approach, covering audio, image, and text, allowing for a broader understanding of the challenges in detecting AI-generated content across different modalities.\n\n\u2022 Rigorous statistical analysis, including regression modeling and Bayesian inference, to examine the influence of various predictors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Lack of real-world context, as participants were explicitly instructed to identify human- and machine-generated media, potentially affecting their performance in more realistic scenarios.\n\n\u2022 Limited representativeness of certain demographic groups, such as participants with low education levels and older individuals, due to the challenges of online panel recruitment.\n\n\u2022 Inability to account for control variables, such as the devices used by participants, which could have influenced their perception, especially for audio stimuli.\n\n\u2022 Potential expiration date of the conclusions due to the rapid advancements in generative modeling techniques, which could render the findings outdated.\n\n\u2022 Absence of a detailed analysis of the generated media quality across different languages and countries, which could have provided insights into the observed differences in performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReal-world Impact:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Raising awareness about the challenges of detecting AI-generated media, which can have implications for various domains, such as journalism, politics, and social media.\n\n\u2022 Informing policymakers and stakeholders about the potential risks and societal impacts of AI-generated media, enabling them to develop appropriate regulations and guidelines.\n\n\u2022 Highlighting the need for improved media literacy and education programs to equip individuals with the necessary skills to critically evaluate and identify AI-generated content.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging further research and development of automated detection techniques, as human detection capabilities alone may prove insufficient in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPotential Future Work:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Investigating the impact of context and real-world scenarios on people's ability to detect AI-generated media, as opposed to the controlled study environment.\n\n\u2022 Exploring the effectiveness of different media literacy interventions or training programs in improving the detection of AI-generated content.\n\n\u2022 Conducting longitudinal studies to track the evolution of human detection capabilities as generative modeling techniques continue to advance.\n\n\u2022 Examining the potential synergies between human and automated detection methods, and developing hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both.\n\n\u2022 Investigating the ethical considerations and societal implications of AI-generated media, and developing guidelines for responsible use and deployment of these technologies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1. What were the primary motivations for conducting this study, and why did you choose to focus on the selected countries and media types?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: The primary motivation was to establish a baseline understanding of people's ability to detect state-of-the-art AI-generated media across different cultural contexts and modalities. We chose the USA, Germany, and China due to the availability of high-quality generative models, the ability to obtain a sufficiently large sample size, and the diversity of cultures represented. The media types (audio, image, and text) were selected because they are commonly targeted by AI-generated content and represent different challenges in terms of detection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ2. Can you provide more details on the process of generating the AI-generated stimuli used in the study, and how you ensured their quality and representativeness?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: For audio, we used state-of-the-art text-to-speech models trained on language-specific datasets to generate synthetic speech samples. For images, we utilized StyleGAN2, a highly capable generative adversarial network, to generate realistic synthetic faces. The generated images were manually checked for quality and matched to real images for consistency. Text stimuli were generated using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model with few-shot learning, where the model was fine-tuned on real news articles and prompted to generate new samples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ3. How did you ensure the representativeness and quality of the participant sample, especially for underrepresented groups like those with low education levels or older individuals?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We relied on a reputable online panel provider, Kantar, to recruit participants and meet representative quotas. However, we acknowledge the challenges in reaching certain demographic groups through online panels, as reflected in our sample's underrepresentation of participants with low education levels and older individuals. To mitigate this, we considered these shortcomings in our analysis and employed statistical techniques to account for potential biases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ4. How did you address potential biases or confounding factors in the study design and data analysis, such as the influence of the experimental setup or the participants' prior knowledge about AI-generated media?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We preregistered our study design and analysis plan to enhance transparency and reduce potential biases. Additionally, we employed Bayesian multilevel modeling techniques to account for potential confounding factors and partial pooling to obtain more robust estimates. However, we acknowledge that the controlled experimental setup, where participants were explicitly instructed to identify AI-generated media, could have influenced their performance compared to real-world scenarios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ5. Can you elaborate on the differences observed between countries and media types in terms of detection accuracy, and what factors might contribute to these differences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We observed significant differences in detection accuracy between countries, particularly for audio data, where German participants performed better than US and Chinese participants. This could be attributed to potential differences in the quality of the generated audio samples across languages. For images, Chinese participants performed slightly better than others in detecting machine-generated content. Text detection accuracy was more similar across countries. These differences may stem from various factors, such as cultural differences, language proficiency, or the quality and representativeness of the generative models used for each language and modality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ6. How do your findings relate to previous work on detecting AI-generated media, and what new insights does your study provide?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Previous work on detecting AI-generated media has often focused on specific media types or relied on small, convenience samples. Our study provides a comprehensive cross-country and cross-media perspective with a large representative sample, allowing for more generalizable conclusions. Additionally, our analysis of personal variables and their influence on detection accuracy offers new insights into the cognitive and social factors that may affect people's ability to identify AI-generated content.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ7. What are the potential limitations of your study, and how might these limitations be addressed in future research?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: One key limitation is the lack of real-world context, as participants were explicitly instructed to identify AI-generated media, which may not reflect their performance in more naturalistic settings. Additionally, our sample had limited representation of certain demographic groups, and we could not account for potential confounding factors like the devices used by participants. Future research could address these limitations by incorporating real-world scenarios, achieving better demographic representation, and considering additional control variables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ8. How do you envision the findings of your study informing policymaking and the development of guidelines or regulations around AI-generated media?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Our findings highlight the challenges faced by individuals in detecting AI-generated media, which underscores the need for policymakers to develop appropriate regulations and guidelines to mitigate potential risks and societal impacts. Our study can inform these efforts by providing insights into the factors that influence detection accuracy and the areas where interventions, such as media literacy education or automated detection techniques, may be most beneficial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ9. What are the potential ethical considerations and societal implications of your findings, particularly in the context of the potential misuse of AI-generated media for disinformation or malicious purposes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Our findings suggest that AI-generated media has become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic content, which raises significant ethical concerns and societal implications. The potential misuse of these technologies for disinformation, fraud, or other malicious purposes could have far-reaching consequences, such as undermining public trust, enabling cyber crimes, or influencing political events. Our study highlights the urgency of addressing these issues through responsible regulation, ethical guidelines, and the development of robust detection and mitigation strategies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ10. Based on your findings, what recommendations would you provide for individuals, organizations, or institutions to better prepare for and respond to the challenges posed by AI-generated media?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We would recommend a multi-pronged approach that includes: 1) Improving media literacy education to equip individuals with the skills to critically evaluate and identify AI-generated content; 2) Investing in the development of automated detection techniques and incorporating human-machine collaboration; 3) Fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations between researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to address the technical, legal, and ethical challenges posed by AI-generated media; 4) Establishing clear guidelines and regulations for the responsible development and deployment of generative AI technologies; and 5) Promoting public awareness and transparency about the capabilities and limitations of AI-generated media to build societal resilience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall Grade: 8/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis paper presents a well-designed and methodologically rigorous study that provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by humans in detecting AI-generated media across different countries and modalities. The large sample size, cross-cultural approach, and comprehensive analysis of personal variables contribute to the generalizability and depth of the findings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe study's preregistration, rigorous statistical analysis, and consideration of various cognitive and social factors demonstrate a high level of scientific rigor. The authors effectively leverage Bayesian multilevel modeling techniques to account for potential confounding factors and obtain robust estimates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the study acknowledges limitations, such as the lack of real-world context and potential biases in the participant sample, the authors transparently discuss these limitations and provide recommendations for future research to address them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe findings of this study have significant real-world impact, as they highlight the urgency of developing appropriate policies, regulations, and educational interventions to mitigate the potential risks and societal impacts of AI-generated media. The authors provide valuable recommendations for individuals, organizations, and policymakers to better prepare for and respond to these challenges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of human detection capabilities for AI-generated media and lays the foundation for future research in this critical area. The comprehensive approach, rigorous methodology, and practical implications justify the high grade of 8/10, although the limitations and potential expiration date of the findings due to rapidly evolving generative modeling techniques should be acknowledged.",

        "selftext": "The 313000a155 paper titled \"AVA: Inconspicuous Attribute Variation-based Adversarial Attack bypassing DeepFake Detection\" makes the following main contributions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Identifies a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack (AVA) that perturbs the latent space via a combination of Gaussian prior and semantic discriminator to bypass DeepFake detectors.\n\n2. Proposes a novel technique utilizing a Gaussian prior in an auxiliary space to optimize DeepFake images inverted in low-density portions to high-density portions, and trains a semantic discriminator to approximately model the distribution of the attribute space.\n\n3. Conducts comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrating AVA's effectiveness in bypassing nine state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors, achieving over 95% success rate on two commercial DeepFake detectors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop 5 Strengths:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Identifies a new and impactful vulnerability in DeepFake detectors that existing defenses cannot mitigate.\n\n\\- Proposes a novel technique to generate imperceptible adversarial examples by manipulating semantic attributes rather than introducing pixel-level perturbations.\n\n\\- Conducts extensive evaluation on both white-box and black-box DeepFake detectors, including commercial systems.\n\n\\- Provides responsible disclosure by reporting findings to affected vendors and organizations.\n\n\\- Includes a human study demonstrating the imperceptibility of AVA-generated DeepFake images to humans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop 5 Weaknesses:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The black-box AVA attack requires a large number of queries to the victim model, which may not be feasible for models with limited queries.\n\n\\- The current black-box AVA attack relies on prediction scores, making it unsuitable for models that only return final label categories.\n\n\\- Due to limitations in attribute editing research, AVA cannot precisely control more detailed attributes like fine hair.\n\n\\- The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of potential countermeasures or mitigation strategies.\n\n\\- The paper does not discuss the ethical implications and potential societal impacts of the proposed attack in depth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReal-world Impact:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The proposed AVA attack poses a significant threat to existing DeepFake detection systems, including those used by social media platforms and other organizations, potentially enabling the spread of malicious DeepFake content.\n\n\\- The findings highlight the need for more robust and resilient DeepFake detection techniques that can withstand advanced adversarial attacks like AVA.\n\n\\- The research raises awareness about the potential misuse of DeepFake technology and the importance of responsible development and deployment of such systems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPotential Future Work:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Develop more efficient and practical black-box AVA attacks that do not require a large number of queries or rely on prediction scores.\n\n\\- Explore potential countermeasures and mitigation strategies against AVA and similar attribute-based adversarial attacks.\n\n\\- Investigate the feasibility of extending AVA to other domains beyond DeepFake detection, such as general image classification or object detection.\n\n\\- Conduct further research on attribute editing techniques to enable more precise control over detailed attributes.\n\n\\- Study the societal and ethical implications of adversarial attacks on DeepFake detection systems and develop guidelines for responsible development and deployment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop 10 Questions to Ask the Authors:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1: What inspired the idea of using attribute-level perturbations to bypass DeepFake detectors, and how did you identify this as a potential vulnerability?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Our initial observation was that existing pixel-level adversarial attacks, while effective, often introduced visible artifacts that could be detected by humans. We hypothesized that manipulating higher-level semantic attributes, which are less perceptible to humans, might be an effective way to bypass DeepFake detectors while maintaining visual quality. Further analysis revealed that attribute-level perturbations could exploit a fundamental limitation of existing detectors, which primarily focus on pixel-level artifacts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ2: Could you elaborate on the process of training the semantic discriminator and how it helps constrain the semantic perturbations within the reasonable attribute space?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: The semantic discriminator is trained adversarially to learn the semantic distribution of normal samples with various attributes. We leverage real images from datasets like CelebA and FFHQ to train the discriminator to distinguish between real samples and the encoder's learned latent codes. As the training dataset increases, the discriminator can better approximate the distribution of the attribute space. This allows us to constrain the semantic perturbations within the boundaries of the learned attribute distribution, preventing the generation of abnormal or unrealistic images.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ3: How did you determine the impact ranking of various attributes on the effectiveness of the AVA attack, and what insights can be drawn from this ranking?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We evaluated the attack success rate of AVA using each individual attribute as the candidate attribute against different DeepFake detectors. By calculating the average success rate across detectors, we could rank the attributes based on their impact on the attack's effectiveness. The ranking provides insights into which attributes are more influential in bypassing DeepFake detectors, potentially due to factors like their perceptual salience or the detectors' focus on certain attributes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ4: What were the key challenges in developing the black-box AVA attack, and how did you overcome them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: The main challenge in the black-box scenario was the lack of access to the victim model's architecture and parameters, making it impossible to compute gradients or establish a loss function for optimization. To overcome this, we utilized a genetic algorithm to search for optimal semantic perturbations by randomly sampling the attribute space and iteratively refining the candidate solutions based on the model's output. Additionally, we incorporated techniques like semantic discriminator and selecting inconspicuous individuals to ensure the generated adversarial examples remained realistic and imperceptible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ5: How did you ensure the imperceptibility of the AVA-generated DeepFake images, and what were the key findings from the human study?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We employed several techniques to ensure imperceptibility, such as constraining the semantic perturbations within the reasonable attribute space and fine-tuning the latent code towards high-density portions of the latent space. The human study findings were crucial in validating the imperceptibility of our adversarial examples. Over 50% of participants perceived the AVA-generated DeepFake images as authentic, and nearly 50% found them as natural as the original DeepFake images, indicating that our approach successfully preserved visual quality while enabling evasion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ6: What were the primary challenges in conducting the comprehensive empirical evaluation, and how did you ensure a fair and unbiased comparison with other attacks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: One of the main challenges was ensuring a consistent and representative evaluation setup across multiple datasets, DeepFake detectors (both white-box and black-box), and attack methods. We carefully selected benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art detectors to cover a diverse range of scenarios. For a fair comparison, we followed the original settings and hyperparameters for each baseline attack method and evaluated them under the same conditions as our AVA attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ7: How did you address the potential ethical concerns and responsible disclosure aspects of your research, considering the implications of a successful adversarial attack on DeepFake detectors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: We took several measures to address ethical concerns and responsible disclosure. First, we obtained necessary approvals from our institution's ethics committee and followed best practices for ethical human subjects research. Second, we responsibly disclosed our findings to the affected vendors and organizations, obtaining their acknowledgments and offering our assistance in mitigating the vulnerabilities. We are committed to engaging with these entities and the broader community to promote the responsible development and deployment of DeepFake detection systems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ8: What are the key limitations of the current AVA attack, and how do you envision addressing them in future work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: One key limitation is the high query complexity of the black-box AVA attack, which may not be practical for models with limited query budgets. Additionally, the reliance on prediction scores limits its applicability to models that only return final labels. Future work could explore more efficient black-box attacks or alternative optimization techniques. Another limitation is the inability to precisely control detailed attributes like fine hair due to current limitations in attribute editing research. As this field progresses, we aim to incorporate more advanced attribute editing techniques into AVA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ9: How do you envision the potential real-world impact of your research, both in terms of potential misuse and in driving the development of more robust DeepFake detection techniques?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Our research highlights a significant vulnerability in existing DeepFake detection systems, which could potentially enable the spread of malicious DeepFake content if exploited by adversaries. However, we believe that by exposing this vulnerability responsibly, we can drive the development of more robust and resilient DeepFake detection techniques that can withstand advanced adversarial attacks like AVA. Our findings underscore the importance of continuous research and vigilance in this domain to stay ahead of potential threats and protect against the misuse of DeepFake technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ10: Given the ongoing advancements in DeepFake technology and detection techniques, what future research directions do you think are most promising or crucial in this field?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely Answer: Some promising future research directions include developing more robust DeepFake detection techniques that can withstand various types of adversarial attacks, not just limited to attribute-based or pixel-level perturbations. Additionally, exploring countermeasures and mitigation strategies against adversarial attacks like AVA could be crucial in enhancing the security and resilience of DeepFake detection systems. Furthermore, investigating the societal and ethical implications of DeepFake technology and developing guidelines for responsible development and deployment could be important to mitigate potential misuse and protect user privacy and safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall Grade: 9/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"AVA: Inconspicuous Attribute Variation-based Adversarial Attack bypassing DeepFake Detection\" paper deserves a high grade of 9/10 for its significant contributions to the field of DeepFake detection and adversarial attacks. The paper identifies a novel and impactful vulnerability in existing DeepFake detectors, proposing a innovative technique to generate imperceptible adversarial examples by manipulating semantic attributes rather than introducing pixel-level perturbations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe authors have conducted a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed AVA attack against nine state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors, including both white-box and black-box commercial systems. The ability to achieve over 95% success rate on commercial detectors highlights the real-world impact and potential security risks posed by this attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of a human study to validate the imperceptibility of AVA-generated DeepFake images to humans adds significant credibility to the research findings. The responsible disclosure efforts by reporting the findings to affected vendors and organizations also demonstrate the authors' commitment to ethical and responsible research practices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the paper has some limitations, such as the high query complexity of the black-box attack and the inability to precisely control detailed attributes, the authors acknowledge these limitations and provide insightful discussions on potential future work to address them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of DeepFake detection and adversarial attacks, exposing a significant vulnerability and driving the development of more robust and resilient techniques. The rigorous evaluation, responsible disclosure, and acknowledgment of limitations further strengthen the credibility of this research. The high grade of 9/10 is well-deserved, and any potential deductions would be minor and subjective based on individual preferences or expectations.",

        "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI know MBTI isn't supposed to change through out your life because the core values and functions are the same, but for some reason (Read: corona and life) in the past few years there has been a drastic shift in my personality.\n\nLike, I used to be apathetic of people who acted on their feelings and couldn't even begin to comprehend why the hell would people listen to their heart rather than head. I couldn't understand why people seemed to be happy with their mediocrity and were content with just sailing through high school. It took me a great deal of acceptance to see that not everyone seemed to have a crippling fear of failure and failing exams or that letting people down didn't petrify them. Basically, even though I was a crackhead, I LOVED making people around me happy and stuff, I DESPERATELY craved for the romance novel kind of love, good at comforting others and being in tune with THEIR emotions, I idolized the INTJ personality.\n\nHeck, I even prided myself in my ability to NOT cry whatever happened *to me*.\n\nBut, the past few years have softened my jagged edges and I feel I have become better as a person... and out of all the MBTI ENFP *does* *seem* to fit me them best... like I relate A LOT with the posts and comments, even my pre corona version included... but the cognitive functions seriously confuse THE HELL OUT OF ME. My minds is swimming with them with no comprehensive solution lmaoaoaooo (SPAIN without the S \\*sigh\\*)\n\nSo, I am giving a brief description of myself and would REALLLLLY appreciate it if you help me figure out my MBTI\n\n1. I can go from having a lighthearted convo to a deep, philosophical/social discussion in the span of a few seconds and with ease as well. My idea of a good weekend is a sleepover where we'd discuss weirdass theories along with the meaning of life and that kind of stuff\n2. I love listening, narrating AND reading stories of people. Like, intricacies of the human behavior, different responses to trauma, psychology and stuff like that ARE REALLLLLY FASCINATING to me. In eighth grade, I read an encyclopedia because I was bored and leaning is interesting\n3. I have been told several times by people that I have extremely funny, almost cartoonish expressions/reactions while conversations (often without me realizing), have theatrical tendencies, expressive eyes and that I gesticulate a lot while speaking. I can go on tangents of my stories as well. Like, it is absolutely necessary for me to clarify EVERYTHING regarding that subject lmao, so I often end up extending the story which could have ben completed in a few minutes. (I have been told this as well) In short: I am verbose.\n4. I can articulate my thoughts and emotions really well. I pride myself in my ability to do so, I'll give you metaphors, similes and all sort of literary devices to explain my points and I don't go like: Oh, I forgot what I was saying\n5. Loads of people including my teachers and friends have told me that I have a child like aura. Like, this innate look innocence of on my face and general demeanor and this curiosity about everything that more often than not, even the teacher is left wondering WHAT TF was I thinking while asking this particular question. My friends have said that I give this vibe of not being tainted by the world and that they feel happy the moment I come with my chaotic entrance.\n6. I am not afraid of looking silly if it means that my friends doesn't feel down in the dumps. 3-4 of my friends have said that I am really good at comforting them and I know exactly what to say in order to abate their overwhelming emotions. I also don't feel uncomfortable with sudden displays of vulnerability like people crying in front of me (but, surprise surprise, I wouldn't be the one crying so easily in front of them lol) But I have absolutely sobbed over stories, you tube videos, shorts, novels and songs. I find it easy to emphasize with people\n7. I am not super sensitive... IDK if it is because of my upbringing, but I don't take things personally and get offended. I have a relatively thick skin. If I don't care about you, you could talk shit and I wouldn't give you the time of my day. If I care about you, I'll take it as a constructive criticism and use that to make myself a better person. You bet I have asked my friends and even teachers at least once in their life what I can do to be better at that task or as a person etc etc\n8. I am that friend who'll be the first to notice the change in your glasses, your earrings, your pouch, your bracelet and that friend who wishes you on your birthdays... probably not the first but yeah, I'll wish you always (it is a different thing that if your birthday is on 18th, I'll remember on 17th it is 18th tomorrow but on 18th I'll forget the effing day of the week and this has happened SO MANY TIMES WTFFFFFFFFF)\n9. I have a wide range of interests. Reading, writing, drawing, debating, oration... basically anything to express my ideas. But I don't really have the SO MANY INCOMPLETE projects. Like I have a lot going on, but a fair amount of them are complete...\n10. I LOVE debating, particularly about ideas I am against because I want to see it the way you do if we disagree. I am open to changing my opinions and views about ideas, if you provide me convincing arguments. But I am also STRONGLY opinionated. I REFUSE to give up on my principles even if it means opening up an easier path because I pride myself in my ability to play things fairly. If I have to choose between the easy path or the right one, I'll take the right one. Every. Single. Time.\n11. I am fiercely independent. This has been detrimental for me (thankfully minor) but I will do things my way if I think I can (even if I over estimate myself) even if the person makes some good points... like if I fail, I want to be accountable for *my* failure\n12. I seldom judge anyone. I feel like everyone has a reason for making the choices they make and no one is inherently good or bad... this *has* made me blind to come flaws but it has helped me to discover the person beneath that veneer they present to everyone else. I also am not prone to jealousy. I remain objective in that sense. Like, if my friends does better than me, I will be genuinely happy for them and cheering them on\n13. I need concrete examples to understand stuff. Like, say for waves in physics, I needed the teacher to demonstrate me beats and beat frequency in real time in order for me to understand. Like, I need a physical manifestation of whatever the concept or even FORMULA is... I also feel like I can do LOADS better at Maths if I were not to be tested academically... I find Maths really interesting because please, we love connecting ideas and stuff together and Maths is just that! But I don't think the current school curriculum is conducive for me to explore it. Also, am I the only one who is super smart when it comes to stuff like word puzzles, riddles, treasure hunt, detective kind of stuff, sudokus and those columns that used to come in newspaper?\n14. I LOVE learning about new things. I do have a more broader understanding of most the the things than depth, but honestly? I couldn't care. I love learning new stuff, new perspectives and... well, you get it PS. I don't feel urges to befriend strangers... again, this could be because of my culture so...\n15. I have sensed several fake people in the past who have gone under my friends' radar. I can also hold grudges really well, mostly if you have hurt my close friends. Usually, I don't bother and just treat them icily/ ignore them but... my friends are a NO NO\n16. Also, for some reason, I feel angry at home? I have always been a LOT more comfortable in my skin when I was with my friends and teachers at school. I felt stifled at home and just irrationally angry/upset. It is the primary reason why I went to college that was considerably far from my home\n17. I also don't associate with people who have like, 0 ambition in life. This sounds quite mean, but till date I have never befriended a person who is content with just winging stuff without putting any effort. Doesn't mean my friends need to be geniuses or straight A students or anything, just that they shouldn't be frolicking around doing nothing. Like, they should be people who want to work on themselves and improve themselves.  Sensible people who are open minded.\n18. IDK, if this is an ENFP thing, but I hate being held down/stifled. I know timetables help, but I feel like my freedom is hindered by them. (please suggestions for this) Likewise, the concept of competitive examinations where you have to study intensely for two years is my idea of hell... I flourish so much better in the college/school environment IDK why though!\n19. A mundane life kind of scares me...? I don't want to live monotonously for the rest of my life. I want some spice, some drama, some excitement\n20. Again, IDK if this is ENFP thing, but I feel like I am more attracted to the mischievous/troublemaker kind of people, who are witty and charming and really smart as well (ENTPs and ENTJs, rather than INTJs). For example, if you give me the vibes of a quiet person, but in reality you have a mean sense of humor and are witty and smart, I. AM. SOLD. I want someone who challenges me, my opinions and has verbal spars with me. Someone who doesn't sugarcoat stuff but also motivates me to improve myself constantly and helps ground me because I spend a considerable amount of time daydreaming into the future lmao\n21. Several teachers have told me that I can do so much better, but I am not putting in my full effort (gee, I wonder *why*) One of them told me that if I put my mind to something, I WILL get it because I am stubborn (I have yet to feel that for something academic ;( )\n22. This could be weird, but between an IT job (which gives me financial security in my country) and an artistic one (my passion, my life), I'd take the IT one and have the artistic one has a side hustle because I don't want to compromise the financial security for my passion... things obviously change if my main job is coming at the cost of my mental health so.\n23. I have no problem standing up to people, especially bullies. I don't even UNDERSTAND MYSELF. Like, sometimes, I'll avoid conflict but then so many times, I have been the one who confronted a person for being rude for no reason etc\n24. I, for some inexplicable reason, make people laugh when I least mean it??? Like, completely unintentionally and I just end up being confused as fck lol\n25. I also have a serious, grass is greener on the other side syndrome\n26. I want to make a difference in the world. Not in a grand way, but I want to teach disable children, contribute stuff to orphanage, be in social service and do something that feels fulfilling. I know it contradicts point 19, but if I were to not worry about money, I'd drop IT at the drop of a hat. I feel like world is a beautiful place because yes, even in this hedonistic world, there is beauty. There is beauty in love, in the rivers, in the vast green grounds. There is beauty in the sky, the creeks, the little things that make you smile. Sure, people are exceedingly materialistic, but I would rather be my idealistic self and stay where I am than to lose myself to material things in order to 'succeed'. I'd have lived a fulfilling life if I made even one person see the beauty in the world and see it through my rose tinted glasses. I'd rather feel so much than be indifferent to it all.\n\nWoah, LMAO, this was a wall of text... Like, the Great Wall Of Confusion... Really puts my thoughts into perspective, I recommend anyone wanting to clear their heads to perform this exercise if you don't mind cramped hands\n\nOnce again, I would appreciate any sort of help\n\nThank you in advance <3",

I think it depends on like life experiences and what you go through, because each thing that you go through has a effect on your life and has you get older you gain knowledge and your views change over time and also how you see and feel and experience things change over time.

        "selftext": "The dream:\nI had this dream late November 2023. I was walking along an empty highway with a light pink, deep fog. As I kept walking, I noticed that there was more greenery the further up I went, as if nature was reclaiming this path I'm on. I eventually came across a fork in the road where this asphalt path led to a forest with a huge tree peeking out of the fog. I took the path and it kinda curved downwards into the opposite direction that I was mindlessly going prior. My path started to transition more from its black asphalt color to something completely covered in vines, grass, and leaves. Behind me, I heard a voice saying \"It's here!\". The voice belonged to a beautiful trans goddess that looked like Sasha Colby, who was standing on top of a huge exposed tree root that acted like a hill bordering between the gigantic tree and the asphalt highway. I knew she was trans and a goddess because of this unspoken knowledge that I was just given, like she just wanted me to know what a divine being she was before I am to interact with her. Also, the asphalt highway was really high up that kinda looked like a wall that was meant to encase this tree, from my pov. I climb the tree root to meet with her and she told me to grab both of her hands. Outside of my dream, I physically felt my hands cupping. We then started praying (I dont know what language it was, but I just started to match her) and then a glowing circle appeared between us, perpendicular to the ground. A floating head of a witch then appeared in my pov but acted as an overlay of what was happening in front of me. She greeted me nicely and I felt welcomed. Both the goddess and the witch told me to pick any numbers I'm feeling and said \"7, 7, 7\" without thinking. I then told them I had to pee irl and they both said it's ok, they'll be right here and ready to pick up where I left off. So outside of my dream, I did my thing and then plopped back into bed and dosed off, where it seems like my hands did the cupping motion on their own again. The witch asked me who do I want to have love me and I said (using initials) TG. I also physically felt my lips move outside of my dream and air coming out as I said the name. The witch then looked shocked and progressively made the most horrifying, ghastly expression I have ever witness, rupturing and violently shaking her head that lasted for a mere moment. During this time, I instinctively had to keep a poker face much like Aang meeting the face stealer. As she calmed down, a see-through white floating board appeared that looked pretty much like an empty sudoku board. I believed the board was floating perpendicular to the ground, but I forgot if they white floating circle was encasing it or disappeared. Random squares were being filled in with a bunch of random angel numbers, but ironically they look like they were placed there with intent. I actually saw 111-999. The goddess then told me to blow on this board and so I did, both my dream self and my physical self. In a friendly, sweet matter, the witch then told me to ask her a couple of questions, which I felt like she implied that I should ask about the future. Here were the questions and their respective answers:\nWill TG fall in love with me? \"Yes.\"\nWill TG eventually move in with me? \"Yes.\"\nWill I be successful in my art? \"Yes.\"\nWill I be successful in my degree? \"Yes and no. Yes meaning you'll get the 6 figure job for a while but you'll then transition to your art.\"\nWhat will happen to RP? \"He will die.\"\nWould RP go back to his exes? \"No.\"\nWill TG and my relationship last? \"Yes.\"\nWill it end? \"Yes, because he will realize you will find (and you have) someone way better for you in both physical and (unintelligible). TG will learn that to love someone will be to let go.\"\nWill he go back to his wife? \"No. He will be happy afterwards for you.\"\n\nThen I thanked them for their time. Everything quickly faded out including the fog, the tree, the goddess and the witch, leaving nothing left. I don't remember anything past that.\n\nThe context: \nI'm in an open relationship with RP that lacks affection (and still is lacking). Staying with current partner until I get my degree and move out. I met a guy back in May 2023 who is married with an indifferent, nonsexual wife. He said his name is JG. We fooled around and had many intimate moments so naturally we both developed feelings for each other. The week after my dream, he said he loved me and we made love, though this time I saw a white glow or aura surrounding him while there was a black hue engulfing him. I broke it off in January because he was trying to see other guys (like me) despite him saying it was just us. TG realized he was in the wrong and so he is going to therapy. Therapist told him not to check in with me for a long time. February, I blocked him on everything because I didn't want to be tempted to intervene in his healing journey. I sent him a neutral text about the blocking and made sure it said \"delivered\" before doing said blocking. Now come this month, I found out he lied about everything including faking his own name which turned out to be TB.\n\nThe purpose of this post:\nI want out if this is something that's already in motion. I know there's a lot of people out there who are just better for me and I don't think I want him to boomerang into my life. I don't know if I fucked up giving them the wrong name in my dream or if they know who the person is irl. So I'm seeking advice, interpretations, or really anything. I am omitting some details in the \"Context\" part, but will be happy to provide more. Thank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "It's so hot here that I'd rather do this than think about the heat. I've got a tub of ice cream and a yogurt drink in front of me right now :')\n\n\\--------------\n\nA legendary monster that appeared in Europe in the 18th century.\n\nA great magician who worked behind the scenes of French society on the eve of the revolution, or a rare genius of a scammer. \n\nAlthough he acted like a noble prince, he provided free treatment in the slums, and was praised by the people in turn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough he was arrested as the mastermind behind the \"Affair of the Diamond Necklace\", the biggest scandal of the century that also involved the Queen of France Marie Antoinette, he was released and received great praise from the citizens. \n\nIn Paris, on the eve of the revolution, he was a true hero that toyed with the nobility and saved the needy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\n**Bond 1**\n\n\\--------------\n\nHeight/Weight: 188cm/85kg\n\nSource: Historical Fact, \"The Queen's Necklace\" by Dumas, etc.\n\nRegion: Europe\n\nAlignment: Chaotic Neutral\n\nAttribute: Man\n\nGender: Male\n\nGreat Dumas describes him in the story as a \"Dark Hero\"-esque figure, similar to the Cave King. If you point this out, Cagliostro will smile, but the Cave King will be disgusted.\n\n\u25c6\n\nThe flames he manipulates are phantom flames, and are a type of mental attack. It is less effective against opponents who do not have a mind. It also works on machines if they have any kind of \"circuit\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\n**Bond 2**\n\n\\--------------\n\nAlthough he was released from the Bastille prison, Count Cagliostro was ordered to be exiled.\n\nViewed as an enemy by the aristocracy and by the church, he was eventually captured in Rome.\n\nHe was found guilty of being \"part of an international conspiracy to topple European dynasties\" as well as \"heretical speech and behavior\" and was thus sentenced to life in prison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no hero named \"Cagliostro\". \n\nThe person that the aristocrats of the time discovered was the pathetic master scammer Giuseppe Balsamo, and that was his true identity. \n\nThey say that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo. Not only Cagliostro, but Giuseppe Balsamo as well was a fake. A false image created by the aristocracy who were afraid of the signs of the coming revolution, in order to bring down the heroes in the public eye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe true identity of Count Cagliostro was----\n\nA magician who manipulated the mysteries hidden in the shadows of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\nBond 3\n\n\\--------------\n\n....But that's not true either.\n\nIn all honesty, he's not even a magician.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough he possesses knowledge of many mysteries, he has only mastered one. A magic seal that brings about eternal youth and super regeneration.\n\nHe never caused an uproar in the world by manipulating magic.\n\nHe used a great deal of knowledge and skill to control people's hearts and gained great renown by pretending to be a fictional character called \"Alessandro di Cagliostro\". \n\n\\----Or so this work has determined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA mysterious character who changes his way of being in the moment. \n\nIn fact, he may not even have a \"true identity\". A person who knew him when he was alive has said that he was referred to as \"Hollow.\u201d (credit to u/UdonSamurai for the TL help)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Diversion Tactic: EX -** Cagliostro brilliantly disguises his existence.\n\nHe can disguise not just his class, but his abilities as well. If a luck check is succeeded after spending a certain amount of time, the opponent will believe that he is on their side. \n\nThe enemy can resist this check, but as it is not a magical effect, anti-magic skills will not apply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For I Am Asherath: EX -** This is not a method of practicing alchemy, astrology, necromancy, the mysteries of Kabbalah, the mysteries of Ancient Egypt, etc.\n\nThe true nature of this skill is deception. It is an extraordinary technique of deception that can even be called a supernatural skill, taking advantage of royalty and aristocracy, and dazzling even the average magician.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\nBond 5 and clearing Ordeal Call 2 - Irreversible Trash Heap: Id\n\n\\--------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Article Casting (False): EX -** A skill that sublimates the legends surrounding the \"Affair of the Diamond Necklace\". \n\nThat's a lie, of course. \n\nIn order to accomplish his schemes, he creates the necessary items himself. It is an altered Item Construction skill, particularly adept at producing counterfeits and modifying and adjusting existing specs.\n\n>!This is also the skill that was used to adjust the fragments of the \"Alien God\" and the soulless vessel (Olga Marie) into becoming a \"Mechanical Avenger\" (this doesn't mean that it was created by simply assembling the fragments. Rather, I made minor adjustments to the divine fragments I discovered so they could each work independently of each other.)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hero's Archenemy (False): E++ -** A skill that shows that he is a great enemy that stands in the way of heroes (or anti-heroes). \n\nNormally, it is a hidden skill often possessed by magical beasts, dragons, demonic beings, and anti-heroes, but this is not the case for the (False) version of the skill.\n\nCagliostro had a deep connection with the Cave King, an event that was not mentioned in history, and there were several conflicts between them.\n\nBecause of this, he recognizes himself as \"The Cave King's Archenemy\" and acquired this skill.\n\n(The fact that he was able to ensnare Marie Antoinette also seems to have been a factor in his acquisition.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Althotas Continuum: C -** There is one truly mysterious thing about him.\n\nThe secret technique of Althotas, the alchemist who was his childhood teacher, is the embodiment of immortality.\n\nWell, it's actually immortality (agelessness) and super regeneration. Not true immortality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\nBond 5 and clearing Ordeal Call 2 - Irreversible Trash Heap: Id\n\n\\--------------\n\n>!Death to Order, Chaos to the World!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|>!Rank: B-EX!<|>!Type: Anti-City/Chaos !<|\n|:-|:-|\n|>!Range: 1-50!<|>!Targets: 500 people!<|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!Ribellione Au Mondo.!<\n\n>!A whirlpool of magical power sweeps through the surrounding area, accompanied by an illusion of the flames of revolution.!<\n\n>!The embodiment of a spirit whose mission is destruction and rebirth, and the imitation of mental landscapes. Similar to a Reality Marble, but different, and accompanied by a special attack against Lawful targets.!<\n\n>!The true power of this Noble Phantasm lies in the \"destruction of order\". While it is by no means permanent, it twists the concept of order to an unsightful degree. Laws, ethics, norms --- sometimes even the rules of the Holy Grail War can be temporarily rewritten. !<\n\n>!However, this strength is not used to its fullest in this work. Additionally, in order to operate at its original scale and effectiveness, it requires a long period of preparation, behind-the-scenes operations, and resource investment.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\nBond 5 and clearing Ordeal Call 2 - Irreversible Trash Heap: Id\n\n\\--------------\n\n>!In Ordeal Call 2, he acts as the final alien apostle. He transformed into the Final Apostle, Cagliostro the Count of Despair, and plotted to kill the Master of Chaldea, but was defeated and expelled by the Avengers and the Master.!<\n\n>!\u25c6!<\n\n>!He claims to have an immortal body, and it is true that he has an immortal body and extremely powerful regenerative ability, but... in Ordeal Call 2, the immortality he displays of \"resurrecting even when one's head is cut off\" is an exception. !<\n\n>!In Ordeal Call 2, when he was invited by Limbo to participate in the \"Imperial Holy Grail War\" (pretending to be a Caster) in the Heian-kyo Singularity/Subspecies Lostbelt, his saint graph and spirit core were tampered with by Limbo. This turned him into a form of \"malignant information\" that is even more difficult to kill and even more likely to spread. (Since this tampering resulted in the irreversible dissolution of his saint graph, the Heian-kyo Holy Grail seems to have determined that \"Servant Cagliostro was destroyed by Limbo\".)!<\n\n>!Cagliostro, as malignant information, infiltrated the Master of Chaldea's mind when they came first came into contact with Limbo and the \"fragment body\". Perhaps because it was malignant information based on Limbo's shikigami, it seems that occasionally the \"nature of the shikigami Limbo mixed in with the saint graph\" would come out. The change in his manner of speaking was obvious, but in the end, a five pointed star (Domanban) appeared on his forehead.!<^(1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\n**Bond CE**\n\n\\-------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Queen's Necklace](https://preview.redd.it/w5ldowf26vqc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d3108b07dae28ae6191c5f59cc385e47183d89d)\n\n\"I was caught up in that strange whirlpool of fate that revolved around this necklace, and even got a taste of the darkness of jail, but... \n\nPlease, take a good look at this dazzling beauty. \n\nI thought about my fate and the royal family, but that's all in the past now. There's nothing else to say. Right now, all I can do is squint my eyes at this brightness.\"\n\n(Count Cagliostro speaking in Chaldea)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[1\\] >!A \"Doumanban\" is a riff off of Seimei's \"Seiman\", or the Seal of Abe-no-Seimei. It's, you guessed it, a five pointed star. lol. Douman's symbol was actually more of a lattice.!<\n\n&#x200B;",

It\u2019s a bit of a long and weird one so bare with! \n\nHowever, some things are on my mind! One thing is that it\u2019s pretty tricky to get me to orgasm, even my husband struggles most of the time and that\u2019s even with a toy at times. It\u2019s down to sexual trauma and medication, I won\u2019t dive into it all but I\u2019ve had therapy to work through what\u2019s happened and I\u2019ve made peace with that. However due to the nature of my traumas, I didn\u2019t have my first orgasm until the age of 21 and that was with a vibrator, I\u2019ve never had an orgasm on my own without a vibrator. It\u2019s very rare my husband can get me to cum with his hands/tounge alone. This is something we\u2019re working on together without a vibrator, but it\u2019s a slow process to find out what I like it seems! \n\n I haven\u2019t straight up told this couple about this, but have made comments about how it\u2019s difficult and it\u2019s met with the expected \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you do\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d While I appreciate the enthusiasm, it\u2019s quite a lot of pressure to perform which won\u2019t do it for me hahah. I had my first orgasm not long before I met my husband, and I was in my sleeping around phase where it didn\u2019t matter as much if I faked it or just didn\u2019t orgasm. \n\nSecondly, I have endometriosis and adenomyosis and my main symptoms is that sometimes I get pain during sex. It can be because of a position going too deep, or just my insides don\u2019t want to play ball that day. Rough sex is often a no go but I won\u2019t know until I\u2019m having sex, and no amount of lube and being turned on is going to change the outcome. \n\nIt sounds silly to be worried about this, but I can\u2019t guarantee I can orgasm or that I won\u2019t get any pain. How do I communicate this to complete strangers? We get on super well, we chat daily about all sorts and for the most part I feel like I can tell them, it\u2019s just worry that they\u2019ll feel a certain type of way (disappointment?) about me lack of ability to orgasm at times or not wanting rough sex or \u201cfinger blasting\u201d \ud83d\ude43 is there a way to be delicate about this situation, as to not offend them that I likely won\u2019t orgasm without basically saying \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d ",

        "selftext": "After beating it recently I felt it didn't do enough to make the Nohr path narratively satisfying on its own, without Revelation or Birthright. And didn't make Garon a good man, just blamed his evil deeds on the world's most obvious case of demonic possession. Everyone still looks moronic for not figuring out their dad is Evil(TM) and probably also possessed by something.\n\nIt is fine if people start out thinking the Tribes are savages who must be oppressed but character growth and exposure to those tribes should challenge that idea and defeat it over the course of a character arc. Instead it comes out of nowhere when King Xander grants the tribes autonomy.\n\nThe Nohrian Blight was a cool idea.\n\nThat scene where Corrin sabotages the peaceful meeting between families... Author, putting Garon on the throne of another nation to cure his demonic possession was a silly plot point you can change. The war can be given noble goals beyond curing one sick old man, Corrin can bring them up at the meeting and enrage the Hoshidans that way.\n\nSomebody could bring up how Azura ended up at Fort Dragonballs to piss the Hoshidans off. Seriously, wtf, Hoshidans? She was raised by the Hoshidans, she's arguably more Hoshidan than Corrin could ever be.\n\nAll of Garon's evil moments could be rewritten as the pragmatic choices of a schemer who would burn the world if it kept his beloved family safe and warm. Recruiting Hans? He can sin when told to and we can kill him and disavow him at will. Keeping Iago around? He's from the richest family in Nohr. Wage war on Hoshido? \"Our people are starving and Hoshido is denying us the right to send out fishing boats because \"everything the light touches is ours, nohrian scum, whoops haha we mistook one of your fishing boats for a pirate ship or invading military vessel again and destroyed it\". When we have hurt Hoshido's capacity to resist our demands we will take enough of their farmland to feed our people and call it a day. Oh no those psycho samurais would rather die than surrender, what a pity, guess we will take over their whole kingdom now, their people will be better off under our rule without the suicidally devoted mindset drilled into them by the wannabe god-kings of that corrupt violent Stepford Smiler hellhole in denial about its serious problems. Have you ever heard of the Hoshidan concept of \"face\"? People bottle up their problems. People endure abuse. Boats crashing and killing hundreds because two idiots higher up wouldn't talk to each other or couldn't say one of them made a mistake. A cruise ship crashed and sank last year and hundreds died if they did as they were told and went back to their cabins and believed everything was fine, the only people who survived looked for themselves and ran for the lifeboats. Kids are considered lazy if they get over four hours of sleep. People living in homes the size of closets go into debt to finance expensive clothing. Kids get plastic surgery to improve their chances of getting a better education and a better job. Extreme poverty is the norm for people outside the top percentile. Farmers plant rocks on sticks to look like they are growing cotton when viewed from overhead while other farmers cry when soldiers are sent to tear out crops they weren't told to grow. Everything we cool pragmatic nohrians would consider vain and tacky is something their hedonistic Hoshidan culture glorifies\". That stuff doesn't even have to be true(the boat sinking while liars lied, the boats aka planes crashing, the fake cotton and soldiers attacking farms, all inspired by IRL things) but it makes sense that someone like Garon would view a foreign culture through the harshest possible lens instead of romanticizing it. Meanwhile the Hoshidans would view themselves through the best lens. \"We're so special, we're so peaceful, we have no reason to war so we don't unless warred on, those Nohrians sleep 8 hours and retire at 60, how lazy, and they have such spartan home decorations unless in the royal family, how lame. And they draft children into the army, not like us, we let kids volunteer after raising them to want it. I swear their military fetish and sigma grindset culture crushes the individualism from their souls.\"\n\nSend Corrin alone to face the Ice Tribe? \"It would be an act of military aggression to send anyone formally in the army but Corrin can go. And her friends and the retainers of her siblings are welcome to tag along. Even Elise, who is technically a noncombatant as a healer. And if she's not still a healer, nobody told the record keeper.\"\n\nWould altering the gameplay of lategame chapters be beyond the scope of the mod? Garonquest had some awesome and brutally hard final maps where Anankos was killed by Garon who became a dragon, the story was a fun mess but the gameplay was epic. The Fates Conquest story is incomplete because you only learn about and face the forces responsible for all the tragedy in the Revelations route. Garonquest worked Rev map stuff into the end, it was great.\n\nRemember the Jet episode of Avatar The Last Airbender? THAT is how you make people unsympathetic towards freedom fighters. Say the Nohrian rebellion Hoshido was sponsoring was going to blow up a major Nohrian city killing countless innocents to also blow up their biggest mines and Nohrian Steel refineries and smiths, and Hans slaughters them after the heroes defeat them because \"My wife and kids live there! Nobody threatens my family and lives!\". If you want to keep Scarlet a good person say she opposed the mission but had to go through with it because they were holding her loved ones hostage.\n\nWhat is this story's theme? Family? People coming together despite their differences?\n\nWhat is the GGG mod's actual goal? Making a good man out of Garon the demonically possessed tyrant out to conquer another land and slaughter its people while employing truly evil underlings who go mwahaha and want Corrin dead or tortured? Making a good country out of Nohr, which could easily be rewritten as a good country that wants Garon gone and someone more reasonable put on the throne? Making a good story out of Fates, one of the worst written stories in all of fiction?\n\nThe Nohrian Blight storyline didn't do enough to make a morally grey conflict out of things because it was too easy for Ryoma to say \"Fine, I'll share food with you if you sod off\". And would it have been truly impossible for Corrin to say \"Remember when mom tried using the throne to cure my amnesia? What if we used it on dad to cure his degrading mental state? The old man is losing it and we miss the good man he used to be, and that good man might be more helpful to you in the future\" Instead of \"can he... maybe... sit on your throne for a bit?\".\n\nYou can make a satisfying arc out of Garon realizing he was wrong, or people realizing Garon was wrong, or anything else like that. But right now the story lacks an arc where the characters grapple with ideas and overcome them. Who questions the Nohrian Way or Hoshidan Way upon seeing holes in that philosophy?\n\nIf you're going to make Garon an evil pawn of an evil dragon who dies in the end anyway, why not rewrite the whole story to be about Corrin and friends trying to gain allies and power every time they are sent on missions, with the dream of overthrowing Garon one day in their heads from the start? Go to fight this rebellion? Tell them, not yet, after nonlethally defeating them. Go to defend this port town? Do that and then visit the nearby Rainbow Sage to learn how the power he gave Garon can be defeated, unintentionally gaining power in the process. Meet your Hoshidan siblings? Tell them, not yet, I'm sabotaging Garon from within and aiding rebellions, and fight them if they doubt you and attack. Garon invades Hoshido? Perfect, let's help him get deep into Hoshidan territory while helping Hoshidan family members fake their deaths, then they can rally their troops and cut off Garon's exit and swarm him with the aid of both families while the rebellions and tribes back in Nohr take out those loyal to Garon back home.\n\nWriter, there is no reason to feel obligated to remain loyal to the original story. But if this is truly your vision, I respect it anyway, and all the work you put into this. This mod is excellent, I just wish it went further and had a clearer goal in mind, a clearer vision of what \"Fates Conquest but written well\" looks like.",

                "body": "I\u2019m of the opinion that there is no way you can frame Garon\u2019s goals in Fates as anything other than purely villainous, so attempting to deflect all of his negative qualities onto Anankos and partially vilifying the Hoshidans is a terrible way to \u201cfix\u201d the story.\n\nI think an easy way to make Garon feel a bit more tragic but still keep his villainy would be to elaborate on what exactly happened during the Concubine Wars that traumatized his children so much. You could make it so that Garon was the kind and supportive father and king like they say he was, but after losing Arete he fell into a deep depression and got radicalized by a cult that worshipped a \u201cSilent God,\u201d after which he becomes more cruel and devious to everyone while his kids can only obey him under threat of severe punishment. This can even better contextualize having Iago and Hans as his lackeys: they could either part of that same cult or even outright be Vallites themselves and everything they do under Garon\u2019s orders is in service to Anankos.\n\nGiven the above, it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch to recontextuslize most of the existing story events around Corrin deciding that Garon\u2019s regime and abuse of his beloved Nohrian siblings was too much and plots to overthrow him. Every time Corrin is sent on a mission to further Garon\u2019s conquest, they make new allies in the potential revolution and slowly convince the siblings to join them (Elise being the first to join, Xander taking the longest) not unlike what you suggested towards the end.\n\nIn short: The best way to fix Conquest\u2019s story is to just go full Pokemon Sun & Moon and make the story about shitty abusive parents and their children who rebel against them, but this time with more magic swords. Crazy how those games released within a year of each other.\n\nI\u2019m actually currently working on a full rewrite with these exact ideas atm. This likely would never turn into a full mod, but I may publish the final thing on AO3 if anyone is interested.",

        "selftext": "A conspiracy theory or some meat in it? Please comment :\n\nUkraine Is Not About Winning The War \n\nWritten by timelord\n\nThe primary motivation for the war in Ukraine is not winning! Most discuss this war as action and reaction. This is too simplistic. \n\nIt is easy to \"tell a tale of two sides\". But, that is only the surface game. The real game runs deep and infects our social structures.\n\nThe threat to players of the game gathered momentum with the populist uprisings around 2016, for example the UK Brexit vote and an unexpected US presidential victory. The people had voted wrongly. And, people elsewhere started voting wrongly. The disease was spreading.\n\nSuppression was to be expected and further down the line if all else fails - then WAR. We got further down the line in 2022. \n\nIn 2020, people actually believed their  their votes would count. But, it turned out a large number of populist candidates, who had been first in the polls, finished the elections second. \n\nWith covid authoritarianism, forced vaccinations, above average death rates, a failing economy, a disaffected populace, and growing Chinese power, there was a sense of urgency to move forward with the \"reset\".\n\nPRIMARY MOTIVATOR \u2014 What do they fear? ACCOUNTABILITY.  The swamp knew early it was going to lose the November US presidential elections and many would face retribution. \n\nSo, why a war in Ukraine? Afghanistan was no longer distracting. The 2022 US elections were looming. Withdrawal from a war gone stale and finding something fresh was necessary.   \n\nBut, why doesn't it stop? Because it is not being fought to win. It is being paced to reach its zenith sometime prior to the US November elections. There will be leeway built in, so probably late summer to autumn. In the mean time, the war must be kept going. \n\nIt is a game and the main players are very experienced, playing for multiple outcomes. There is rarely any action which does not have multiple possible plus  benefits for the players. Moreover, there are different levels of players, each with its own objectives, loyalties and awareness. \n\nThe top tier's primary objective in Ukraine is to prevent the election in November of a US populist leader intent on cleaning house. They want to avoid being held accountable. They went too far. For them, it is do or die.\n\nThe top tier players of the West cannot concede. They demonized another nuclear power who also cannot concede. The game ideology is a matter of timing brinkmanship. The idea is to use the Russian bogeyman to instill fear among Western populations. This will trigger \"emergency powers\" sometime prior to November, a plan that removes constitutional rights AND SUSPENDS ELECTIONS!! A win for the players and a a dictator's dream, an example of history repeating itself.\n\nThe major danger they don't get, probably because most of them are too young to understand the cold war, is that the demonized enemy also has a stake in this.  \n\nPre-emptive strikes can be authorized if there is a clear and credible threat. Does this sound familiar? It should. We hear it whenever a new war is announced.\n\nSo, how would the Russians take it if our leaders ramped up hysteria over an imminent, yet fake, nuclear attack? It would appear as an imminent credible threat!\n\nThe game is insane and moreover if put under enough pressure, the players are willing to burn the house down with everyone inside. They think we don't know...Distraction & confusion everywhere.\n\nIsrael is in the same boat. It has its own top tier players. For Washington, the Gaza War is a back up if Ukraine runs out of steam, a great distraction. Brown lives do not matter. And, even though it now seems like the Gaza war might run out of steam first, there are always multiple options for intelligence community operations. It's all about the timing of steam!",

        "selftext": "I want to try doing my version recap of the more confusing events so far and trying to explain it in a cohesive and understandable way, or at least, the way I believe is going. Be warned that it will be long as I'll try to hit all and more points to make it the most clear as possible. For that, let's start by explaining some points first that you should keep in mind:\n\n\u2022 Materia are condensed mako energy that contain the memories, emotions and desires of something that the planet and the Lifestream \"registered\". For example, the summon materias contain the memories of the creatures that once roamed the planet and allow to manifest them once again.  The Black Materia contain the anger, hatred and desire of death of the Gui in the form of Meteor. The White Materia contain the desire and memories of those wanting to protect the planet in the form of Holy.\n\n\u2022 Normally the way the story progress should be always the same as the OG (+ plus compilation), like a river that never change course. In order for that to be the case, the planet created another Weapon-like beings called the Whispers, who can also fuse together in one giant being called the Arbiter of Fate. These beings, normally invisible, make it so everything proceed as intended. They appear only when someone try to mess with the natural order, much like their \"cousins\" Weapons, and try fixing it by affecting people's memories and/or intervening directly as obstacle. In case, they can also take someone from a world and manifest it in another (read next)\n\n\u2022 When someone manage however to defy fate, making a choice not intended (indicated by a rainbow light), a new World is created by the Lifestream, where things continue following that decision and what differenciate them are a different Stamp mascot dog breed. Those worlds however are temporary. No matter what, sooner or later something will happen to these worlds that will cause their destruction (the beginning of the end is shown via a crack in the sky) and fading back in the Lifestream, and the people who inhabit them knows it too. The Edge of Creation, the place where Cloud fought against Sephiroth first alone, then with Zack and then alone again, is nothing more than one of these worlds, stuck in a frozen time, 7 seconds before its complete destruction (imagine watching the end of the world and 7 seconds before it all goes boom, you press the pause button). It is also possible for said Worlds to come in contact (like when Cloud peeked into one of Zack's worlds or Aerith felt his hand when she came in contact with the Lifestream) and merge for a brief period of time under the right conditions.\n\nNow for the story, I'll talk about what we know SO FAR and what most likely happened (since we still miss some details):\n\n\u2022 After his defeat in the OG and Advent Children, Sephiroth, back in the Lifestream, find a way to send his memories back to his past self with the intention of changing things so that he can win. Aerith, who is also in the Lifestream following her death, does the same (that's why in Rebirth, Aerith talk about having lost her memories in Junon). This alert the whispers and make them intervene. \n\n\u2022 Sephiroth decide to change his approach and start tormenting Cloud by appearing to him much earlier on and will keep appearing more than once in his mind and through the black robed ones in ordsr to always keep him mentally at edge and thus more easy to manipulate later. \n\n\u2022 After the bombing, Cloud arrive and see Aerith getting harassed by the whispers who are trying to take away her memories of the future (as she said at Shinra HQ, each time the whispers touch her, she starts to forget). Because she touched him, he becomes able to see the whispers as well. And afterward, by coming into contact with the rest of Avalanche, they begin to see them as well. \n\n\u2022 Due to the whispers being busy with Aerith and Sephiroth disturbance, some things don't go quite the same, like Jessie doesn't get badly injured, thus Tifa wouldn't have to go to the next bombing mission. In order to fix that, the whispers manifest and intervene. Like the day of the mission, they attack and injure Jessie. And when the plate is supposed to fall, they make it so that Jesse and Biggs get fatally wounded. They do however fail to ensure that Wedge dies in the plate fall. \n\n\u2022 While Cloud is going on his adventure with Aerith and later with Tifa as well, Yuffie begin her journey with Sonon at Shinra HQ where she end up confronting Scarlet and later Nero from Deepground, who kills Sonon and retrieve his body. Yuffie escape just in time to see the plate fall. \n\n\u2022 Meanwhile Aerith who still have her memories of the future, end up showing bits of the future to Marlene (which does support the popular theory that Marlene has Cetra blood in her) at 7th Heaven and Red XIII in Shinra's Lab. However when she start talking about Sephiroth and the big threat all represent to the squad, basically things that shouldn't be said yet, the whispers arrive and start taking more of her memories of the future away, but Tifa help avoiding losing them all for now. \n\n\u2022 Once the team reach President Shinra who get killed by Sephiroth, the latter attempt to kill Barret, but the whispers intervene asap to heal him before it's too late (they even attempt to remove Sephiroth's memories of the future as well, but he shoo them away) while the rest of the gang fight Jenova, manifested through another black robed guy.\n\n\u2022Unknown to them, Wedge joined the other group of Avalanche and assaulted Shinra HQ, and as the plan failed, Wedge is pushed by the whispers out of the window and fall to his death. \n\n\u2022 As the group proceed to escape, more and more whispers appears due to the way too many changes happening and encircle Midgar with the plan to trap Cloud&co. and make it so that everything goes as intended. Since however Sephiroth is passing through, that could end up badly so they follow in with a breach opened by Aerith to try changing things. This leads to them entering another World (yes, one of those I mentioned above), where they fight against the Arbiter of Fate who manifest the villain trio of Advent Children to fight them. The party however manage to defeat them. \n\n\u2022 This however becomes a problem, as now that the whispers are weakened (not killed), Sephiroth, presumably thanks to his deep connection to the Lifestream (we lack conclusive evidences on the method in which he took control of them, but this seems the most logical explanation for now), take control of some of the whispers (the famous black whispers), becoming an arbiter of fate himself and use its newfound power to manifest himself physically and test himself against Cloud & co. The group does manage to beat him tho, (although Sephiroth didn't go all out of course) and Cloud gets transported to the Edge of Creation of this World to have a chat and brief duel against Sephiroth, before being transported back with the others in their world. Another problem also arise as both Red and Aerith during the fight got touched enough by the whispers to lose pretty much all their future memories. \n\n\u2022 At the same time, in another world, Zack was having his final fight, but at the same time as black whispers were born, white whispers (probably controlled by OG Aerith but could be the planet itself) arrive to him and protect him, making it so he won't die and thus enter a new World. The same world where Biggs (if it's ours or another doesn't matter) got sent to after the white whispers saved him and brought him here. \n\n\u2022 Now as far as Zack's story go, the good news is that the details don't actually matter. What matters is that Zack now is an anomaly as he's constantly in a World where he shouldn't exist and thus whenever he takes some decision (like choosing who to save or not) he basically create a new World where things still go bad by the end, but seems to get saved by the white whispers whenever he's about to die again and moved to another World. It's basically Stein's Gate. And Zack is trying to help Cloud and Aerith. \n\n\u2022 Back to main timeline, things proceed as usual for the most, although like I said, both Red and Aerith don't really remember the future anymore and the white materia Aerith had has become empty (unclear for now why but presumably it happened when either she opened the portal at the crossroad or because the whispers took away the memories inside that form the spell).\nThe party progress until they reach Gongaga and they head to the reactor after hearing a Weapon roar. There they follow the black whispers and Sephiroth, who has been gasliting for a while Cloud to make him doubt Tifa, pushes him to attack Tifa who fall in the water and get eaten by a small Weapon. This lead to Tifa witnessing from inside the Weapon first visions of her past, since they were basically in the Lifestream, and then the battle between the black whispers of Sephiroth and the white whispers+Weapons who wants to protect the planet (and almost get killed by him too). \n\n\u2022 After Tifa is rescued and Cloud's conditions keep getting worse, the party keep going on until they reach the Temple of the Ancients. First the group sans Cloud has to endure their greatest traumas again without breaking or giving up. Then Sephiroth explain (and continue in the Forgotten Capital) his plan: merge all the worlds into one via sufficient negative emotions and use Meteor to destroy all them at once, so he can truly become omnipotent and make his victory eternal (basically his original plan on steroids). It's also suggested that Aerith by coming in contact with the Lifestream there, regained the memories of OG Aerith, as she start talking differently to Sephiroth and knows that the Black Materia there isn't the right one. \n\n\u2022 Speaking of, the Black Materia there according to Sephiroth isn't the real one because that was lost between Worlds. How that happened we don't know yet. Nevertheless, Sephiroth start taunting Cloud and the others by puppeting him into playing fetch with the wrong Black Materia. Yes, Sephiroth litterally treated Cloud like his personal pet dog. And by the end, Cloud and Aerith fall into the Lifestream. We know it's that, because Cloud then wake up in another (dying) World amd has a date with OG Aerith (yes, it's her, it's heavily implied) who by the end, give him a new white materia and send him back before Sephiroth, who also is in the Lifestream, remember, arrive presumably to attack her. Cloud wake up, give the white materia to his Aerith and then goes night night until the rest of the group reach them and then Aerith leave for the Capital.\n\n\u2022 At the Capital, the black and white whispers are fighting and the black ones block the passage to Aerith, and thanks to the white ones (who reminder, are the ones who want to protect the planet), Cloud and ONLY HIM pass through. Je reach Aerith, resist the push of the black whispers to make him attack Aerith and instead manage to deflect Sephiroth's attack, seemingly creating a World where Aerith didn't die, while in his own, she's still dead. This new Aerith does still fall unconscious like the other ones in the other Worlds tho. The merging also start as Cloud start seeing both his and that other world at the same time (even Tifa does for an instant).\n\nThis is probably the hardest part to understand due to lack of info currently, so a lot of it will be in the more likely rather than definitive.\n\n\u2022 So after beating Jenova, the whispers bring Zack to Cloud and the two of them found themselves into another Edge of Creation to fight against Sephiroth, who however get rid of Zack soon after pushing him into another dying World. Due to the merging, this next battle will basically be on 3 different planes against Reborn Sephiroth: Cloud at the Edge of Creation, Zack in the dying World and the rest of the group in the main world. (Imagine doing a 3 v 1 only you can't see the other 2 fighting with you). And once that is done, Aerith, OG Aerith, manifest herself thanks to the white whispers (like Sephiroth did with his black ones), and we know it's most likely her as her exchange with Cloud and Sephiroth implies it heavily. Plus the edge of creation it's litterally a few seconds from returning to the Lifestream and we know she's in there. Together they beat Sephiroth who for the first time, actually looks pissed and retreat, as the Worlds separate again.\n\n\u2022 Glenn, who so far tried to push Rufus to get into a war against Wutai, once the gig is up, reveal itself as another illusion of Sephiroth who wanted to keep him distracted from him (considering Rufus did help later in taking down the shield protecting Sephiroth) \n\n\u2022 Zack get saved again by the white whispers and end in another World, hoping to reunite with Cloud and Aerith again, while Cloud goes back to his group, who are mourning their Aerith's death. Cloud however, either because he's seeing both his and the other World where Aerith was saved, or because his mind is so broken he can't accept her death, see Aerith waking up and keep seeing her when others don't. Most likely however he is indeed seeing both Worlds as he also see the crack in the sky and Aerith tell him to leave her behind as she'll keep praying. Before leaving, Cloud also remember to have the empty materia and also find presumably the real Black Materia and put it into his sword.\n\nAnd that's about it. If you have read to the end, thank you very much. Like I said, there are still some things we don't know or don't have sufficient evidences yet to say for sure, but I think a good chunk is explained already and the puzzle isn't missing as many pieces as it seems. The big questions left now are:\n\n1) What happened to the White Materia of Aerith to become empty? \n\n2) Why was the Black Materia lost between worlds and a fake one was at the Temple instead? \n\n3) What is the ultimate goal for Zack and maybe Biggs? \n\n4) How does Sephiroth plan to merge the worlds again? \n\n5) How will the conflict with Wutai develop?\n\n6) Is Cloud hallucinating or is he seeing the other Aerith all the time? And if it's the latter, how will she affect the plot moving forward? ",

(You will feel bad)\n\nHowever - if you have too much certainty - you will feel BORED and Overwhelmed. That's a feeling of being stuck in a predictable, boring routine.\n\nAnd in many cases, including mine - boredom is one of the main triggers for addiction, because you will tend to look for something that can excites you. And nothing can excites you more than something that gives you so much PLEASURE!\n\n**Bad Certainty Behavior:** Overeating, control of others, binge watch TV/Netfilx/Anime, procrastination, etc..\n\n**Manage your certainty by** \\- cleaning, developing empowering rituals(workout, exercise, meditation, reading, etc), focusing on the things you want in life, instead of listening or following others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **UNCERTAINTY / VARIETY**\n\nYou might be asking - *''but* ***why the Heck I need Uncertainty?''***\n\nThat's the FUN part. It will get you out of the BOREDOM of certainty.\n\nOur human needs are built in a very strange way, that they actually are in conflict with each other. But if you look deep - you will understand that it is exactly what gives your life Drive and Excitement!\n\nThat's why you need Uncertainty, or in other words - **Variety.**\n\nYou need to have something unpredictable happening in your life, or else - **it will be boring!**\n\nThat's like - eating one and the same dish all the time. Very soon - you will get bored or even sick of it!\n\n**Bad Uncertainty Behavior:** Overwhelm, drug, intoxication, change TV channels/Anime/Netfilx, Self sabotage, create drama and problems.\n\n**Manage your Uncertainty by:** new challenges, changing the meaning of events, hobbies, be creative, learn and discover new things\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **LOVE & CONNECTION**\n\nIn short - if you don't care about this - you will feel LONELY.\n\nAnd loneliness is the **MAIN trigger/reason for you to stay in this addiction!** No matter you like it or not!\n\nLove & Connection is when you feel that someone is actually caring about you.

        "selftext": "ik this is going to be a long post, so yeah.  \n\nTLDR: i wish i could have a easier life, but according to this guy\u2019s mom, she thinks i need therapy because i have poor social cues, i vent too much, tells me that her son (21) can\u2019t be around anyone who i associate with, or people who are ND like him. \n\nso, this guy\u2019s mother texted me with \u201cdo you really think you should be venting to people (your friends) about his autism? it\u2019s embarrassing that he has autism, and you venting about it embarassed the hell out of everyone in his family, you are a dumpster fire. You should try therapy, it would make your life easier. it makes my 16 and 14 yo\u2019s life easier especially that they go to a drama filled school.\u201d then his mom said \u201cyou're the side chick that\u2019s why i texted you off my sons phone. And he is not interested in you. Regardless leave my son alone.\u201d then his mom said \u201cAnd? His actions say otherwise. ((his friend who is also my friend) is lying to you because she set you and my son up, she even admitted it to me when i asked her through my sons account) Do you really want to be a side chick? i\u2019m sure you don\u2019t, but if you continue to talk to my son and find out the truth which you kinda do know the truth tbh. but fr, you should be with someone who is on your lifestyle, ND or NT\u201d. then his mom said \u201cleave my son alone! and if i find out you\u2019re texting him, i\u2019ll tell you that he\u2019s taking a nap.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, youre mad because i texted you off my 21 yos phone. he is incapable to be on social media without me or his father monitoring who he\u2019s talking to. you went to a drama filled school with questionable people at every angle. I\u2019d recommend that you seek therapy. my 16 yo ND son and 14 yo NT daughter go to the drama filled school and they\u2019re in therapy, and they avoid most of the people there except family friends, and sports friends\u201d. then his mom said \u201cBecause you\u2019re having trouble understanding that you\u2019re the problem. And it seems as though you confuse the drama that you surround yourself (however negative to others, but to durfee people it\u2019s normal to have drama and that\u2019s not good). i went to the drama filled school myself as a teen and i know how it is there. which is why my 21 and 19 yo didn\u2019t go to the drama filled school, sadly my 16 and 14 yo go to the drama filled school, but thankfully they\u2019re in therapy so they won\u2019t have issues with social cues as an adult. i personally went to therapy in high school myself when i was pregnant with my 21 yo. You also tend to need help recognizing the social cues that others give. A skilled therapist that specializes in your field can help you build positive life skills and improve your ability to recognize unhealthy patterns and behaviors. That is, if you\u2019re willing to be a decent human being.\u201d \n\ni understand that therapy can fix people, from what other people have told me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou have so much drama (due to where you went to school since it is a drama filled school) you vent so much about how my 21 yo blah blah blah, it\u2019s insane. you basically control him, like you felt uncomfortable when he stayed the night at his 17 yo coworkers house. And you always say no when i tell you to leave my 21 yo alone. There comes a time that you need to realize that no one can change anything for you. You have to do that. Good luck.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cBreanna, I do not mean this in a rude way at all, but.... Do you not have any friends in person? i would understand that because you went to a drama filled school, people there are all rude and snotty, you only fit in if your parents went there or you have family friends there.  If your parents didn\u2019t go to durfee or you don\u2019t have family friends who went to durfee, it would make sense that you didn\u2019t have real friends and were a loner due to not fitting in. as if you do not have someone in \"real life,\" to talk to. I also see from what my sister in law (maya) who is in a facebook group you\u2019re in, told me your mom is against therapy. I think it is pivotal for you to seek out therapy, and real friends. I know it can be hard to make friends, there are apps out there that can help you make friends, like yubo, bumble (friends version), wizz, discord servers, there is also therapy apps and online services since you don't drive, from what my son told me.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cI love that you\u2019re talking to people outside of your state, they seem more nicer!!! Sometimes people from the drama filled school are not the best to vent to. I suggest getting an app that has therapy. Do you have access to your insurance information? I feel as if a professional would be best. I know that with autism your thought process differs, I think getting a therapist will help show you thinking patterns and behaviors that could help you work through most of the struggles you are having due to being in a drama filled school as a teen.  Also possibly getting yourself an advocate., you can get them through social services. I feel as if you want to gain your independence but are struggling with the direction to take, due to being in a school where teachers cared more for drama then learning\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, it's time to leave my son alone, ik you don\u2019t wanna hear that tho deep down, but it\u2019s the truth\u201d. then his mom said \u201cyou always vent to your friends, but never want to listen to what i have to say and you just want pity.\u201c then his mom said \u201cI think u need to find a new hobby, instead of messaging my son\u201d. then his mom said \u201cI personally think you may help\u2026or a hobby at least\u2026so you stop venting about my son and about his \u201cautism\u201d it\u2019s cringe, idk why he has autism tbh, that\u2019s why when he got older (5th grade) i put him in sub seperate classes because it\u2019s more gen ed and not a bunch of mentally incapable people\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl you are a dumpster fire. I\u2019m calling bs on you being nd: if you were \u201cND\u201d, you would realize that your my 21 yo (who is ND) may have a mom protecting his routine and hinting to shut it off, and he has asked me for help to read to help him understand your cues. i personally think you were tested with the wrong diagnosis as a kid, and your mom is protective of you because it\u2019s common in your hometown (the same city i live in) for young adults to be sheltered, or barely hangout/go out with friends. which is why i got pregnant as a teen with my 21 yo so i can have a normal life as an young adult.\u201d \n\nthe fact his mom said i\u2019m probably faking my autism is actually just fcked up tbh. it sounds ableist imo, when she has 3 ND sons (21,19,16).\n \nthen his mom said on tiktok from what my friend (20, his friend) told me, \u201cFor the triggered drama filled school people who are in this group. You really should try to educate someone that has autism, instead of letting them have free time during the day.  I don't need to be told about the various types of autism. It's called a spectrum for a reason. Because it varies \ud83d\ude44 I also have 3 sons who are ND, it\u2019s genetic from my husbands side of the family. he isn\u2019t ND. So if anyone is gonna come at me, at least make sense. this girl doesn\u2019t want advice on WHY her behaviour isn't okay (texting my son, venting about my son and his autism). she thinks she is ND because he is ND, but she is nowhere near ND, she doesn\u2019t understand why i checked his phone, that\u2019s NT behavior.\u201d \n\nthen his mom commented \u201cif anyone defends breanna, you\u2019re embarrassing yourselves fr. autism isn't an excuse to be venting on the internet about a stranger you met on snapchat. And please don't refer autism as a \"disability\", because i am not proud that my 21,19 and 16 yo are ND, but sadly they are and can\u2019t live like a NT person. Her behaviour isn't okay in many of her little vents and she needs to be held responsible for it.\u201d\n\nmy friend (20F,his friend) commented on his moms post because it was on her FYP saying \u201cwhy are you being rude to her over the fact your son really likes her. Life is hard as it is. You can be kind to her\u201d. then his mom said to my friend \u201ci have a feeling she is NT, and is faking to be ND to get with my son, She seems too function just fine. 21 is incapable of a lot of things. 19 and 16 are more higher functioning. 16 is in sub separate classes at the drama filled school. 19 and 21 were in sub separate classes in middle school. I don't like people that use autism as an excuse to vent on the internet. ffs,wow. can't have a conversation That says more about your intelligence and why you\u2019re a stoner \ud83d\udc4c I've reported you on tiktok for being a $lut, I don't engage with people who post $lutty things on tiktok. They aren't worth my time. Have a lovely rest of the night \ud83d\ude18\u201d. then my friend said to his mom \u201cAutism is literally a neurological developmental DISABILITY. Just because you or anyone else might not see it as one, doesn't mean that it's not an actual disability. You can't compare someone else, to your 3 sons because nobody is the same as someone else. Everyone handles things differently and she never said her autism is the excuse for anything. She was mentioning it to better explain to you jumping down her throat, why she does some of the things that she does. she was venting to her friends, it doesn't matter if it\u2019s \u201cdrama\u201d, she's 20 years old and almost all 20 year olds have constant drama going on in their lives. you apparently have a problem with her venting but yet take the time to tell her negative things & rude attitudes instead of just being a decent person. youre literally talking about how she's all drama and telling her to grow up and how she's childish/immature and a whole dictionary worth of things, are also causing more drama that she\u2019s  complaining about. It solves absolutely nothing and only makes her feel worse. Do yourself a favor and leave her alone, because she's allowed to be here despite what she vents.\u201d then his mom said to my friend,  \u201cimagine defending someone who\u2019s possibly a victim of munchausen by proxy and trying too tell them what they should think. Girl. Sit down. You are projecting your feelings and I honestly couldn't care less.\u201c then my friend said to his mom, \u201cNice straw man argument, miss girl. In case you\u2019re confused, comparing one person\u2019s truth to another\u2019s is in no way a valid point. To point out that 21,19 and 16 do or say \u2018such & such\u2019, therefore breanna should be able to do or say \u2018such & such\u2019 makes no sense. Furthermore, and forgive my wording if not proper in this instance, but the level of ND from one person to the next is wildly different. Surely you know this since you too are apparently on the \u201cspectrum\u201d. (Hint: refer to dictionary\u2019s definition of the word \u2018spectrum\u2019. Actually, I\u2019m curious why you sent messages to breanna through 21\u2019s account? My point is: who the h311 are you to assert that \u201cshe seems to function just fine\u201d? Not that I agree with this convaluted opinion, but YOU don\u2019t even appear to believe that judging by your comments\u2026 like you think he isn\u2019t capable to be on social media by the fact you check 21\u2019s phone. i\u2019m ND myself as you know, and my mom is strict herself but she wouldn\u2019t go on my phone and text people off my phone.\u201d \n\nthen my friend @ me and said \u201canyone with a lick of sense can see that 21\u2019s mom opinion is weird & convoluted. Not sure why she\u2019s so mad, but u have done absolutely nothing wrong. you are free to vent, i know 21\u2019s ex or whatever dmed you on tiktok.  Please girl, don\u2019t pay any mind to her or 21\u2019s ex or whatever. Their opinions aren\u2019t worth your energy. Clearly she is in need of some anger management.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cThis reads like Blah blah blah, I'm literally acting like a victim over being attacked by 21\u2019s mom, and getting messages by 21\u2019s mom through 21\u2019s phone.  Move on with your life. it's super unhealthy that you care so much about someone\u2019s mom texting you through their sons phone.  Trust me none of this will matter in 6 months. Especially not if you're stoned while posting this.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cdue to you being in a drama environment school as a teen, You need therapy. It sounds like you come from a very toxic family (due to where you grew up) and don't know how to form healthy bonds with the outside world, due to where you grew up. This will only get worse for you if you don't get some help, i know all this because i went to the same high school you did and most people there are unhinged and enjoy drama. which is why i sent my 21 and 19 yo to a vocational school because there\u2019s no drama there and it\u2019s a strict environment. Please put the effort into yourself to heal from your toxic upbringing.  And please for the love of the earth, do not date until you've gone to therapy for a whole year. I hope my 21 yo never runs into you, anyone like you (autistic,ND) or anyone you associate with. my 21 yo will never be dating anyone from that red flagged a$$ school that graduated there, ain\u2019t no fckin way. neither will my 19 and 16 yo, my 16 yo goes there so i\u2019m worried he\u2019ll end up dating someone from that trashy a$$ school. thankfully my 14 yo NT daughter knows better and is dating someone from a vocational school. my 13 yo NT son is a good kid so he prob don\u2019t even care about dating tbh, he\u2019s the most decent 13 yo in this generation.\u201d then his mom said \u201cthe reason why to get therapy is because your unhealthy mindset wouldn\u2019t be a thing in you.  Life is actually is much better after therapy.  Everything is easier. my 16 and 14 yo are in therapy due to them being decent people and not being saints due to the school they go to, and it\u2019s helped them realize they are better off talking to people and having friends from decent schools who know better, and show your vents about my son to your therapist when you go to therapy because that will help them so much in treating you.\u201c then his mom said \u201chow many times are you gonna vent about my son and what i do with him do you need to do, and be told to grow up. All you do is vent about my son to your friends and why did his mom take his phone and message me and it\u2019s childish bull \ud83d\udca9 and you know damn well why i texted you through his phone. you are a STRANGER to him and to me, idc what that grimey a$$ friend of his tells you, she is manipulating him into dating you because she thinks i\u2019ve arranged him to date that girl abigale told you about. the one that\u2019s insane is you, you\u2019re absolutely off your rocker and it\u2019s making me think you\u2019re psycho, my sister in law (maya) even told me you\u2019re psycho because you mentioned you were mad over the fact he spent the night at a girls house idc if she was a minor, yes she was a minor, but why does that matter, me and his father grew up with her family so it\u2019s okay\u201d. \n\nmy opinion: the fact this woman checks his phone, but allows him to go to a bar is just WILD to me.. and first off, it\u2019s not okay that he slept at a minors house. he\u2019s 21 she\u2019s 17. \n\nthen my friend commented back to his mom, \u201cgirl take your pick me self elsewhere. My statement obviously meant \u201cwe\u2019ve all had drama\u201d You\u2019re grown. Act it. She\u2019s 20. You\u2019re all attacking her. Only people that need to grow up is YOU.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cno I've never been there\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this isn't normal drama. this is trashy school drama that she complains so much because i went through 21\u2019s phone how dumb are you because you normalize drama for some reason how did you survive private school in high school like tell me because you must have gotten bullied so hard in high school \ud83e\udd23 she needs to get real help.\u201d then my friend said to his mom, \u201cyou are being nasty to this poor girl not keeping in mind that she still has so much to learn about herself, and so much growing to do. Think back on how you were at those ages and how you are now. Those are two different people. Stop jumping the gun and immediately attacking her. There\u2019s ways to talk to people. Imo you need to seek help on the way you speak to people. Nasty bitter person imo.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cIt's when she asks why she could possibly need therapy that makes me irritated. She doesn't want advice she wants to be told she's right and i\u2019m wrong for checking 21\u2019s phone when he\u2019s incapable to be on social media\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cYou constantly vent about my son, and don't want me offering you advice on how to seek help. Clearly 20 (my friend) is so naive and dumb to see how you actually are. You NEED help or else you will never be happy. i hope if you still are with my son in the future which you guys will end up getting a divorce and you\u2019ll probably be a single mother because you\u2019re such a unhappy person, my grandkids better not go to that trashy a$$ school thankfully my son will not let that happen because he wants his future kids to have a good education and go to a good school one day. just informing you that, but i know you won\u2019t be sticking around with my son for that long\u201d. then his mom said, \u201cbut, you asked my son why i texted you through his phone. how do you not see that you\u2019re the problem? you have proven that you aren\u2019t letting it go with how you are so confused as to why an adult man\u2019s mother is texting you through their sons phone\u201d. \n\nbut, didn\u2019t this mother again let her son stay the night with a 17 year old, let her son go to a BAR.. yeah he\u2019s old enough to drink, but like she gets in his personal life that\u2019s the weird part to me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cOk, you are the one bringing the fact that i took my sons phone to text you, so who's actually the problem here. Grow up\u201d. then his mom said \u201cYou need to grow up. geez. So much drama about how i went on my son\u2019s phone to text you and you are causing it. this is not the day of our lives \ud83d\ude12\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201clike i said, She's literally 20 years old and Autistic. I doubt you were even \"grown\" at 20 especially considering our frontal lobes aren't even fully formed until 25.\u201d then his mom said to my friend \u201ci was mature at 20, i had 21 at 17, and 19 when i was 19. i had 2 kids already when i was 20. you need to realize that she is causing drama when it isn't needed. It happened almost a week ago, yet she has re started it by venting about it. Also, you need to realize that she starts it all by the fact she texted 21 at 2am one night. I suggest she engage in a psychologist.\u201d \n\nthen his mom told me, \u201cyou need to take accountability for your actions, you messaged my son at 2am, i had the damn right to text you to leave, there was no need to text him at 2am, idc if you were asking what he was up to or if you saw he was active online. it\u2019s disgusting for someone to text the opposite seggs at 2am\u201d. \n\nhow\u2019s it disgusting that i was asking him how his night was going\u2026.\n\nthen his mom said, \u201cWhy are you so drama filled? i get you went to a school that has basically drama, you literally walk around thinking why did his mom contact me through  her sons phone, Who in their right mind texts someone at 2am... nobody but you. You need a hobby that doesn't involve the internet or unhinged friends.\u201d \n\nmy opinion: \u201cunhinged friends\u201d is just irrelevant because that\u2019s just wild she assumes how my friends are. \n\nthen his mom told me to stop venting about her son. \n\nthen his mom said to my friend \u201cchill out, and if you would realize she vents about my son and that she is drama for it you would be a decent person but no you seem to like drama and that\u2019s who breanna associates with is people who like drama\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cyou are the type of person who asks why do parents get involved in their sons life while they\u2019re dating or talking to me, it\u2019s because you texted my son at 2am.\u201d \n\nthen my friend responded to his mom \u201cask yourself why you care so much. Move on. You do realize, that when you say breanna is just looking for drama... and you are actively sitting here for like over an hour arguing with her is giving her drama, right? Unless you're the one looking for drama. None of your comments were necessary. Talking about this young GIRL being nothing but drama and yet your initial comment was specifically to START drama. Make it make sense \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \u201c\n\nthen his mom said to me \u201ctexting someone at 2am is harassment\u201d. i wasn\u2019t even doing anything except asking how his night was going. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou literally blame me for your actions, you\u2019re genuinely poor, 20 (my friend) defending you is so delulu of her\u2026\u201d \n\nthen my friend told his mom to leave me alone. then, my friend said to his mom \u201cDelulu? Because i\u2019m defending my friend who\u2019s a 20 year old autistic girl, No. The Delulu one would be you that seems to think it's necessary to just attack this girl because she is venting about how toxic you are. She's trying to vent her feelings in the best way that she knows. If anyone needs to grow up, it's YOU that get off on bullying people on the Internet. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\nthen, his mom is telling my friend \u201cso you think i should leave her alone? the fact you\u2019re saying i\u2019m being mean towards her is just actually fcked, what did i even do like i\u2019m being protective over 21 and want what\u2019s best for him and breanna is no role model for him! wow\u2026 the fact this is how drama filled school people go through life being told they are always right when she is blatantly inviting trouble, she texted 21 at 2am nobody is online or active at 2am except poor people. her \u2018autism\u2019 aside is just embarrassing autistics and poor people are just the most troubled people in this world, she truly is troubled and needs her help with her other personality disorders that she probably has but wasn\u2019t diagnosed because the city doesn\u2019t know how to be doctors and diagnose people with the right diagnosis, Its actually troubling and people believing she\u2019s autistic is actually just so wild it\u2019s how dumb they are. do you not realize she is antagonizing me? i\u2019m literally being a great parent. she has made lots of peoples lives so bad and traumatized them\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201cthe fact you had to spread false information about her is just so wild\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen my friend told me \u201cshe\u2019s dumb as h*ll \ud83d\ude2d Like, hating on you for your feelings.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cI lost braincells. You definitely need a different hobby because you constantly vent about my son and how i went on his phone to text you. you are the problem. you\u2019re so senseless\u201d. then his mom said \u201cur victimizing yourself over me texting you through my sons phone. stop chasing after my son\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cYou are exhausting. U need to grow up and stop being childish imagine what you\u2019re gonna be like in a few years, god damn you\u2019re bonkers. you need help. you\u2019re absolute childish for what you did. texting someone at 2am is sick asf it gives stalker vibes. you don\u2019t get the fact you need therapy and the fact you asked why you need it is actually embarrassing. you will be in a healthy place mentally if you were to go to therapy.\u201d",

        "selftext": "ik this is going to be a long post, so yeah.  \n\nTLDR: i wish i could have a easier life, but according to this guy\u2019s mom, she thinks i need therapy because i have poor social cues, i vent too much, tells me that her son (21) can\u2019t be around anyone who i associate with, or people who are ND like him. \n\nso, this guy\u2019s mother texted me with \u201cdo you really think you should be venting to people (your friends) about his autism? it\u2019s embarrassing that he has autism, and you venting about it embarassed the hell out of everyone in his family, you are a dumpster fire. You should try therapy, it would make your life easier. it makes my 16 and 14 yo\u2019s life easier especially that they go to a drama filled school.\u201d then his mom said \u201cyou're the side chick that\u2019s why i texted you off my sons phone. And he is not interested in you. Regardless leave my son alone.\u201d then his mom said \u201cAnd? His actions say otherwise. ((his friend who is also my friend) is lying to you because she set you and my son up, she even admitted it to me when i asked her through my sons account) Do you really want to be a side chick? i\u2019m sure you don\u2019t, but if you continue to talk to my son and find out the truth which you kinda do know the truth tbh. but fr, you should be with someone who is on your lifestyle, ND or NT\u201d. then his mom said \u201cleave my son alone! and if i find out you\u2019re texting him, i\u2019ll tell you that he\u2019s taking a nap.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, youre mad because i texted you off my 21 yos phone. he is incapable to be on social media without me or his father monitoring who he\u2019s talking to. you went to a drama filled school with questionable people at every angle. I\u2019d recommend that you seek therapy. my 16 yo ND son and 14 yo NT daughter go to the drama filled school and they\u2019re in therapy, and they avoid most of the people there except family friends, and sports friends\u201d. then his mom said \u201cBecause you\u2019re having trouble understanding that you\u2019re the problem. And it seems as though you confuse the drama that you surround yourself (however negative to others, but to durfee people it\u2019s normal to have drama and that\u2019s not good). i went to the drama filled school myself as a teen and i know how it is there. which is why my 21 and 19 yo didn\u2019t go to the drama filled school, sadly my 16 and 14 yo go to the drama filled school, but thankfully they\u2019re in therapy so they won\u2019t have issues with social cues as an adult. i personally went to therapy in high school myself when i was pregnant with my 21 yo. You also tend to need help recognizing the social cues that others give. A skilled therapist that specializes in your field can help you build positive life skills and improve your ability to recognize unhealthy patterns and behaviors. That is, if you\u2019re willing to be a decent human being.\u201d \n\ni understand that therapy can fix people, from what other people have told me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou have so much drama (due to where you went to school since it is a drama filled school) you vent so much about how my 21 yo blah blah blah, it\u2019s insane. you basically control him, like you felt uncomfortable when he stayed the night at his 17 yo coworkers house. And you always say no when i tell you to leave my 21 yo alone. There comes a time that you need to realize that no one can change anything for you. You have to do that. Good luck.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cBreanna, I do not mean this in a rude way at all, but.... Do you not have any friends in person? i would understand that because you went to a drama filled school, people there are all rude and snotty, you only fit in if your parents went there or you have family friends there.  If your parents didn\u2019t go to durfee or you don\u2019t have family friends who went to durfee, it would make sense that you didn\u2019t have real friends and were a loner due to not fitting in. as if you do not have someone in \"real life,\" to talk to. I also see from what my sister in law (maya) who is in a facebook group you\u2019re in, told me your mom is against therapy. I think it is pivotal for you to seek out therapy, and real friends. I know it can be hard to make friends, there are apps out there that can help you make friends, like yubo, bumble (friends version), wizz, discord servers, there is also therapy apps and online services since you don't drive, from what my son told me.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cI love that you\u2019re talking to people outside of your state, they seem more nicer!!! Sometimes people from the drama filled school are not the best to vent to. I suggest getting an app that has therapy. Do you have access to your insurance information? I feel as if a professional would be best. I know that with autism your thought process differs, I think getting a therapist will help show you thinking patterns and behaviors that could help you work through most of the struggles you are having due to being in a drama filled school as a teen.  Also possibly getting yourself an advocate., you can get them through social services. I feel as if you want to gain your independence but are struggling with the direction to take, due to being in a school where teachers cared more for drama then learning\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl, it's time to leave my son alone, ik you don\u2019t wanna hear that tho deep down, but it\u2019s the truth\u201d. then his mom said \u201cyou always vent to your friends, but never want to listen to what i have to say and you just want pity.\u201c then his mom said \u201cI think u need to find a new hobby, instead of messaging my son\u201d. then his mom said \u201cI personally think you may help\u2026or a hobby at least\u2026so you stop venting about my son and about his \u201cautism\u201d it\u2019s cringe, idk why he has autism tbh, that\u2019s why when he got older (5th grade) i put him in sub seperate classes because it\u2019s more gen ed and not a bunch of mentally incapable people\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cGirl you are a dumpster fire. I\u2019m calling bs on you being nd: if you were \u201cND\u201d, you would realize that your my 21 yo (who is ND) may have a mom protecting his routine and hinting to shut it off, and he has asked me for help to read to help him understand your cues. i personally think you were tested with the wrong diagnosis as a kid, and your mom is protective of you because it\u2019s common in your hometown (the same city i live in) for young adults to be sheltered, or barely hangout/go out with friends. which is why i got pregnant as a teen with my 21 yo so i can have a normal life as an young adult.\u201d \n\nthe fact his mom said i\u2019m probably faking my autism is actually just fcked up tbh. it sounds ableist imo, when she has 3 ND sons (21,19,16).\n \nthen his mom said on tiktok from what my friend (20, his friend) told me, \u201cFor the triggered drama filled school people who are in this group. You really should try to educate someone that has autism, instead of letting them have free time during the day.  I don't need to be told about the various types of autism. It's called a spectrum for a reason. Because it varies \ud83d\ude44 I also have 3 sons who are ND, it\u2019s genetic from my husbands side of the family. he isn\u2019t ND. So if anyone is gonna come at me, at least make sense. this girl doesn\u2019t want advice on WHY her behaviour isn't okay (texting my son, venting about my son and his autism). she thinks she is ND because he is ND, but she is nowhere near ND, she doesn\u2019t understand why i checked his phone, that\u2019s NT behavior.\u201d \n\nthen his mom commented \u201cif anyone defends breanna, you\u2019re embarrassing yourselves fr. autism isn't an excuse to be venting on the internet about a stranger you met on snapchat. And please don't refer autism as a \"disability\", because i am not proud that my 21,19 and 16 yo are ND, but sadly they are and can\u2019t live like a NT person. Her behaviour isn't okay in many of her little vents and she needs to be held responsible for it.\u201d\n\nmy friend (20F,his friend) commented on his moms post because it was on her FYP saying \u201cwhy are you being rude to her over the fact your son really likes her. Life is hard as it is. You can be kind to her\u201d. then his mom said to my friend \u201ci have a feeling she is NT, and is faking to be ND to get with my son, She seems too function just fine. 21 is incapable of a lot of things. 19 and 16 are more higher functioning. 16 is in sub separate classes at the drama filled school. 19 and 21 were in sub separate classes in middle school. I don't like people that use autism as an excuse to vent on the internet. ffs,wow. can't have a conversation That says more about your intelligence and why you\u2019re a stoner \ud83d\udc4c I've reported you on tiktok for being a $lut, I don't engage with people who post $lutty things on tiktok. They aren't worth my time. Have a lovely rest of the night \ud83d\ude18\u201d. then my friend said to his mom \u201cAutism is literally a neurological developmental DISABILITY. Just because you or anyone else might not see it as one, doesn't mean that it's not an actual disability. You can't compare someone else, to your 3 sons because nobody is the same as someone else. Everyone handles things differently and she never said her autism is the excuse for anything. She was mentioning it to better explain to you jumping down her throat, why she does some of the things that she does. she was venting to her friends, it doesn't matter if it\u2019s \u201cdrama\u201d, she's 20 years old and almost all 20 year olds have constant drama going on in their lives. you apparently have a problem with her venting but yet take the time to tell her negative things & rude attitudes instead of just being a decent person. youre literally talking about how she's all drama and telling her to grow up and how she's childish/immature and a whole dictionary worth of things, are also causing more drama that she\u2019s  complaining about. It solves absolutely nothing and only makes her feel worse. Do yourself a favor and leave her alone, because she's allowed to be here despite what she vents.\u201d then his mom said to my friend,  \u201cimagine defending someone who\u2019s possibly a victim of munchausen by proxy and trying too tell them what they should think. Girl. Sit down. You are projecting your feelings and I honestly couldn't care less.\u201c then my friend said to his mom, \u201cNice straw man argument, miss girl. In case you\u2019re confused, comparing one person\u2019s truth to another\u2019s is in no way a valid point. To point out that 21,19 and 16 do or say \u2018such & such\u2019, therefore breanna should be able to do or say \u2018such & such\u2019 makes no sense. Furthermore, and forgive my wording if not proper in this instance, but the level of ND from one person to the next is wildly different. Surely you know this since you too are apparently on the \u201cspectrum\u201d. (Hint: refer to dictionary\u2019s definition of the word \u2018spectrum\u2019. Actually, I\u2019m curious why you sent messages to breanna through 21\u2019s account? My point is: who the h311 are you to assert that \u201cshe seems to function just fine\u201d? Not that I agree with this convaluted opinion, but YOU don\u2019t even appear to believe that judging by your comments\u2026 like you think he isn\u2019t capable to be on social media by the fact you check 21\u2019s phone. i\u2019m ND myself as you know, and my mom is strict herself but she wouldn\u2019t go on my phone and text people off my phone.\u201d \n\nthen my friend @ me and said \u201canyone with a lick of sense can see that 21\u2019s mom opinion is weird & convoluted. Not sure why she\u2019s so mad, but u have done absolutely nothing wrong. you are free to vent, i know 21\u2019s ex or whatever dmed you on tiktok.  Please girl, don\u2019t pay any mind to her or 21\u2019s ex or whatever. Their opinions aren\u2019t worth your energy. Clearly she is in need of some anger management.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cThis reads like Blah blah blah, I'm literally acting like a victim over being attacked by 21\u2019s mom, and getting messages by 21\u2019s mom through 21\u2019s phone.  Move on with your life. it's super unhealthy that you care so much about someone\u2019s mom texting you through their sons phone.  Trust me none of this will matter in 6 months. Especially not if you're stoned while posting this.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said \u201cdue to you being in a drama environment school as a teen, You need therapy. It sounds like you come from a very toxic family (due to where you grew up) and don't know how to form healthy bonds with the outside world, due to where you grew up. This will only get worse for you if you don't get some help, i know all this because i went to the same high school you did and most people there are unhinged and enjoy drama. which is why i sent my 21 and 19 yo to a vocational school because there\u2019s no drama there and it\u2019s a strict environment. Please put the effort into yourself to heal from your toxic upbringing.  And please for the love of the earth, do not date until you've gone to therapy for a whole year. I hope my 21 yo never runs into you, anyone like you (autistic,ND) or anyone you associate with. my 21 yo will never be dating anyone from that red flagged a$$ school that graduated there, ain\u2019t no fckin way. neither will my 19 and 16 yo, my 16 yo goes there so i\u2019m worried he\u2019ll end up dating someone from that trashy a$$ school. thankfully my 14 yo NT daughter knows better and is dating someone from a vocational school. my 13 yo NT son is a good kid so he prob don\u2019t even care about dating tbh, he\u2019s the most decent 13 yo in this generation.\u201d then his mom said \u201cthe reason why to get therapy is because your unhealthy mindset wouldn\u2019t be a thing in you.  Life is actually is much better after therapy.  Everything is easier. my 16 and 14 yo are in therapy due to them being decent people and not being saints due to the school they go to, and it\u2019s helped them realize they are better off talking to people and having friends from decent schools who know better, and show your vents about my son to your therapist when you go to therapy because that will help them so much in treating you.\u201c then his mom said \u201chow many times are you gonna vent about my son and what i do with him do you need to do, and be told to grow up. All you do is vent about my son to your friends and why did his mom take his phone and message me and it\u2019s childish bull \ud83d\udca9 and you know damn well why i texted you through his phone. you are a STRANGER to him and to me, idc what that grimey a$$ friend of his tells you, she is manipulating him into dating you because she thinks i\u2019ve arranged him to date that girl abigale told you about. the one that\u2019s insane is you, you\u2019re absolutely off your rocker and it\u2019s making me think you\u2019re psycho, my sister in law (maya) even told me you\u2019re psycho because you mentioned you were mad over the fact he spent the night at a girls house idc if she was a minor, yes she was a minor, but why does that matter, me and his father grew up with her family so it\u2019s okay\u201d. \n\nmy opinion: the fact this woman checks his phone, but allows him to go to a bar is just WILD to me.. and first off, it\u2019s not okay that he slept at a minors house. he\u2019s 21 she\u2019s 17. \n\nthen my friend commented back to his mom, \u201cgirl take your pick me self elsewhere. My statement obviously meant \u201cwe\u2019ve all had drama\u201d You\u2019re grown. Act it. She\u2019s 20. You\u2019re all attacking her. Only people that need to grow up is YOU.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cno I've never been there\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this isn't normal drama. this is trashy school drama that she complains so much because i went through 21\u2019s phone how dumb are you because you normalize drama for some reason how did you survive private school in high school like tell me because you must have gotten bullied so hard in high school \ud83e\udd23 she needs to get real help.\u201d then my friend said to his mom, \u201cyou are being nasty to this poor girl not keeping in mind that she still has so much to learn about herself, and so much growing to do. Think back on how you were at those ages and how you are now. Those are two different people. Stop jumping the gun and immediately attacking her. There\u2019s ways to talk to people. Imo you need to seek help on the way you speak to people. Nasty bitter person imo.\u201d then his mom said to my friend, \u201cIt's when she asks why she could possibly need therapy that makes me irritated. She doesn't want advice she wants to be told she's right and i\u2019m wrong for checking 21\u2019s phone when he\u2019s incapable to be on social media\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cYou constantly vent about my son, and don't want me offering you advice on how to seek help. Clearly 20 (my friend) is so naive and dumb to see how you actually are. You NEED help or else you will never be happy. i hope if you still are with my son in the future which you guys will end up getting a divorce and you\u2019ll probably be a single mother because you\u2019re such a unhappy person, my grandkids better not go to that trashy a$$ school thankfully my son will not let that happen because he wants his future kids to have a good education and go to a good school one day. just informing you that, but i know you won\u2019t be sticking around with my son for that long\u201d. then his mom said, \u201cbut, you asked my son why i texted you through his phone. how do you not see that you\u2019re the problem? you have proven that you aren\u2019t letting it go with how you are so confused as to why an adult man\u2019s mother is texting you through their sons phone\u201d. \n\nbut, didn\u2019t this mother again let her son stay the night with a 17 year old, let her son go to a BAR.. yeah he\u2019s old enough to drink, but like she gets in his personal life that\u2019s the weird part to me. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cOk, you are the one bringing the fact that i took my sons phone to text you, so who's actually the problem here. Grow up\u201d. then his mom said \u201cYou need to grow up. geez. So much drama about how i went on my son\u2019s phone to text you and you are causing it. this is not the day of our lives \ud83d\ude12\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201clike i said, She's literally 20 years old and Autistic. I doubt you were even \"grown\" at 20 especially considering our frontal lobes aren't even fully formed until 25.\u201d then his mom said to my friend \u201ci was mature at 20, i had 21 at 17, and 19 when i was 19. i had 2 kids already when i was 20. you need to realize that she is causing drama when it isn't needed. It happened almost a week ago, yet she has re started it by venting about it. Also, you need to realize that she starts it all by the fact she texted 21 at 2am one night. I suggest she engage in a psychologist.\u201d \n\nthen his mom told me, \u201cyou need to take accountability for your actions, you messaged my son at 2am, i had the damn right to text you to leave, there was no need to text him at 2am, idc if you were asking what he was up to or if you saw he was active online. it\u2019s disgusting for someone to text the opposite seggs at 2am\u201d. \n\nhow\u2019s it disgusting that i was asking him how his night was going\u2026.\n\nthen his mom said, \u201cWhy are you so drama filled? i get you went to a school that has basically drama, you literally walk around thinking why did his mom contact me through  her sons phone, Who in their right mind texts someone at 2am... nobody but you. You need a hobby that doesn't involve the internet or unhinged friends.\u201d \n\nmy opinion: \u201cunhinged friends\u201d is just irrelevant because that\u2019s just wild she assumes how my friends are. \n\nthen his mom told me to stop venting about her son. \n\nthen his mom said to my friend \u201cchill out, and if you would realize she vents about my son and that she is drama for it you would be a decent person but no you seem to like drama and that\u2019s who breanna associates with is people who like drama\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cyou are the type of person who asks why do parents get involved in their sons life while they\u2019re dating or talking to me, it\u2019s because you texted my son at 2am.\u201d \n\nthen my friend responded to his mom \u201cask yourself why you care so much. Move on. You do realize, that when you say breanna is just looking for drama... and you are actively sitting here for like over an hour arguing with her is giving her drama, right? Unless you're the one looking for drama. None of your comments were necessary. Talking about this young GIRL being nothing but drama and yet your initial comment was specifically to START drama. Make it make sense \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \u201c\n\nthen his mom said to me \u201ctexting someone at 2am is harassment\u201d. i wasn\u2019t even doing anything except asking how his night was going. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cyou literally blame me for your actions, you\u2019re genuinely poor, 20 (my friend) defending you is so delulu of her\u2026\u201d \n\nthen my friend told his mom to leave me alone. then, my friend said to his mom \u201cDelulu? Because i\u2019m defending my friend who\u2019s a 20 year old autistic girl, No. The Delulu one would be you that seems to think it's necessary to just attack this girl because she is venting about how toxic you are. She's trying to vent her feelings in the best way that she knows. If anyone needs to grow up, it's YOU that get off on bullying people on the Internet. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\nthen, his mom is telling my friend \u201cso you think i should leave her alone? the fact you\u2019re saying i\u2019m being mean towards her is just actually fcked, what did i even do like i\u2019m being protective over 21 and want what\u2019s best for him and breanna is no role model for him! wow\u2026 the fact this is how drama filled school people go through life being told they are always right when she is blatantly inviting trouble, she texted 21 at 2am nobody is online or active at 2am except poor people. her \u2018autism\u2019 aside is just embarrassing autistics and poor people are just the most troubled people in this world, she truly is troubled and needs her help with her other personality disorders that she probably has but wasn\u2019t diagnosed because the city doesn\u2019t know how to be doctors and diagnose people with the right diagnosis, Its actually troubling and people believing she\u2019s autistic is actually just so wild it\u2019s how dumb they are. do you not realize she is antagonizing me? i\u2019m literally being a great parent. she has made lots of peoples lives so bad and traumatized them\u201d. \n\nthen my friend said to his mom \u201cthe fact you had to spread false information about her is just so wild\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen my friend told me \u201cshe\u2019s dumb as h*ll \ud83d\ude2d Like, hating on you for your feelings.\u201d \n\nthen his mom said to me \u201cI lost braincells. You definitely need a different hobby because you constantly vent about my son and how i went on his phone to text you. you are the problem. you\u2019re so senseless\u201d. then his mom said \u201cur victimizing yourself over me texting you through my sons phone. stop chasing after my son\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nthen his mom said \u201cYou are exhausting. U need to grow up and stop being childish imagine what you\u2019re gonna be like in a few years, god damn you\u2019re bonkers. you need help. you\u2019re absolute childish for what you did. texting someone at 2am is sick asf it gives stalker vibes. you don\u2019t get the fact you need therapy and the fact you asked why you need it is actually embarrassing. you will be in a healthy place mentally if you were to go to therapy.\u201d",

Tickets were expensive. \n\n\u2014 \n\nI met Becca\u2019s family. They were wonderful. \n\n\u2014 \n\nAfter months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90\u2019s shows, listening to new \u201cbest of\u201d playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  \n\nIt was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. \n\nIn truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: \u201cdas ist normal.\u201d \n\nTickets weren\u2019t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently\u2014the film was supposed to be good.  \n\nI was curious from a typical filmgoer\u2019s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* \n\nBy some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were \u2026 *strange*. It's like they\u2019re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* \n\nA tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this \u201cexquisite gem\u201d of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. \n\nI took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. \n\nSoon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  \n\nThen the movie started. \n\n\u2014 \n\nThe opening scene is loud. It\u2019s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don\u2019t know my medieval times)*.* We\u2019re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  \n\nA skewer goes through my stomach.  \n\nI\u2019m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon\u2019s dead body. \n\n*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* \n\nI exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  \n\n*It\u2019s just a movie. Just pretend it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s all you're here to see.* \n\nAfter a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie\u2019s plot. And to my surprise, I do. \n\nVery quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  \n\nIn subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, \u201cI would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.\u201d The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. \n\nAs luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet\u2014on one of the meat skewers. There\u2019s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom\u2019s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina\u2019s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  \n\nThe wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. \n\nThat night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m your new husband.\u201d \n\nPolina is of course scared. Confused. \u201cYou\u2019re my new husband?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.\u201d \n\nPolina\u2019s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil\u2019s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. \n\nThrough title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty \n\n\u201cWhy are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town\u2019s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. \n\nIn the morning, Polina\u2019s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. \u201cThe pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor\u2019s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig\u2019s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina\u2019s dead husband-to-be. \n\nPolina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. \n\nOn Polina\u2019s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. \u201cHe gets along well with the children,\u201d Polina explains. \n\nAlthough the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. \n\nBut the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  \n\n\u201cHow come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. \n\nShe leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  \n\n\u201cNow lay with me.\u201d The swine says.  \n\nTeeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that\u2019s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig\u2019s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. \n\n\u201cWrap an arm around me.\u201d \n\nPolina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. \n\n\u201cA wife must lay with her husband,\u201d The pig says. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will. Or your soul is mine.\u201d \n\nWithout much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig\u2019s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  \n\n\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d \n\nThe pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig\u2019s molars.  \n\nAt this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  \n\nIt is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  \n\nThey are about to kiss.  \n\nAre they actually going to?  \n\nThey do.  \n\nI hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. \n\n*\u201cMein Gott \u2026 \u201d* \n\n*\u201cWiderlich.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cIt must be fake \u2026 \u201d* \n\nBut it\u2019s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human\u2019s mouth like an over-excited dog. \n\nPolina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. \n\n\u201cKiss me! KISS ME!\u201d \n\nWhen I look back at the screen, Polina\u2019s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. \u201cThe Devil has my daughter!\u201d  \n\nThe pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. \n\nWe see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  \n\nFade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina\u2019s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. \n\nShe is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. \n\nWith nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. \n\nThe camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what\u2019s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds \u2026 she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. \n\nWhen we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I\u2019ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. \u201c*Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119? Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119?\u201d* \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo you are not.\u201d The pig\u2019s voice returns. \u201cYou have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.\u201d   \n   \nPolina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d She yells. \n\n\u201cYour soul is forfeit. It is mine.\u201d \n\nPolina takes her hands in her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. \n\nThere\u2019s squealing. Screaming. \n\n*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  \n\n\u201cAnd because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.\u201d \n\nSomething invisible takes a bite of Polina\u2019s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. \n\nThen the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. \n\nI feel a panic attack coming on. I can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can\u2019t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. \n\nI plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It\u2019s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. \n\n*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* \n\nBut then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. \n\nThis Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire \u2026 emerges a ten foot demon.  \n\nThe thing from hell. \n\nEveryone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. \n\nThe thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.\u201d Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. \u201cNo no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.\u201d \n\nI held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. \n\nEven now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. \n\nIt was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  \n\n*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* \n\nThe sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. \n\nNow here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time \u2026 mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. \n\nMy heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can\u2019t unsee it. I can\u2019t unhear it.  \n\nIt is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. \n\nThe screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. \n\n\u2014 \n\nWhen I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. \n\nI am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? \n\nI wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. \n\nI look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  \n\nThe applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. \n\nThe director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d  Olek says. \n\n\u2014   \n   \nCatharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nOn stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. \n\nAnd then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. \n\n\u201cWho did your cinematography? It was beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere did you find your actors? Unbelievable.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you pull off those VFX? How?\u201d \n\nSomething inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* \n\n*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* \n\nI was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? \n\n*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. \n\n\u201cMurderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!\u201d \n\nPatrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. \n\nI began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. \u201cAdrian Kowalski! Pawe\u0142 Nowak! Martyna Wi\u015bniewska! \u2026\u201d I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. \n\nA security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. \n\n\u201cPlease do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.\u201d \n\nI finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. \n\n\u201cShe is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,\u201d Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. \u201cA man named \u0141ukasz D\u0119browski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.\u201d He lifted his hand, \u201cI \u2026 was one of those students\u201d \n\nSharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*\u2019s. \n\n\u201cYes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.\u201d \n\nAudience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real \u0141ukasz actually found and arrested? \n\nBefore I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. \n\nJust another attention seeker. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOnce the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating\u2014I was trudging through molasses. \n\nTo make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. \n\nI did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn\u2019t just blow off my partner. \n\n\u201cAnna! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!\u201d \n\nI gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. \n\n\u201cWe should get a couple drinks!\u201d Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. \u201cEveryone\u2019s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!\u201d \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* \n\nSo despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn\u2019t want to be recognized as \u2018*that person at the Q&A*\u2019, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cCould you feel it in the room?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou mean, the energy? The magic?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!\u201d Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. \u201cThat was insane!\u201d \n\nI nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the guy?\u201d One of Becca\u2019s new friends asked. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy!\u201d Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. \u201cAnna, you\u2019ll never believe this, but I\u2019ve got some amazing news. You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d \n\nI knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets \u2026* \n\n\u201cIm shooting his next one. I\u2019m officially his next DP!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome!\u201d The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  \n\nThe information passed through me. It didn\u2019t register. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great Anna?\u201d Becca hovered her martini close to mine. \n\n\u201cIsn't what great?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shooting Olek\u2019s next movie. My first art house, I\u2019ve caught my big break!\u201d \n\nI stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s \u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know! Crazy right!\u201d She bumped my glass and took a big swig. \n\nI crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can\u2019t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You can never do it. Please don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  She indicated \u2018another round\u2019 to the bartender. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at the hotel.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnna, are you alright?\u201d \n\nI shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn\u2019t follow. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel?\u201d She called behind my back. I didn\u2019t reply.  \n\n\u2014 \n\nI was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can\u2019t be happening. There\u2019s no way any of this is real.* \n\nI bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. \n\nI wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. \n\nI closed my eyes. *You\u2019re gonna be okay. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re gonna be okay.* \n\nThen a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* \n\nWhen I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  \n\nOlek was in my room. \n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said. \n\nI stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. \n\nAnd yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. \n\n\u201cBerlin huh?\u201d \n\nI tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn\u2019t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. \n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the movie?\u201d \n\nI briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? \n\n\u201cYou know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.\u201d He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. \u201cDo you want me to fix it again?\u201d  \n\nIce cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. \u201cN-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.\u201d \n\nHe walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were the first one I\u2019ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?\u201d \n\nOutside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek\u2019s reflection. \u201cDo you like mercy?\u201d \n\nI cleared my throat. Nodded. \n\n\u201cGood. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her\u201d He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. \n\n\u201cSpeaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?\u201d \n\nMy eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn\u2019t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. \n\n\u201cI couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot \u2026 she\u2019s forever gone.\u201d \n\nHis dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. \n\n*Don\u2019t move. Remain steady. Don\u2019t show fear.* \n\n\u201cIt is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.\u201d \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. \n\nI pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. \n\n\u201cYou're within reach.\u201d Is all he eventually said.  \n\nThen he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  \n\nBut Olek wasn\u2019t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a party happening. An underground club. You\u2019re welcome to join if you want.\u201d \n\nI was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* \n\nHe seemed to be able to read my face. \n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d \n\nHe turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik\u2019s presence vanished down the hall. \n\nI ran over and shut everything\u2014applied all locks.  \n\nThen I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? \u2026 Do I \u2026 Did that \u2026 actually just happen?* \n\n*Am I dreaming?* \n\nI grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  \n\nBehind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything\u2019s wiped. This can\u2019t be happening. \n\nAfter a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  \n\n*I must have just woken up. That\u2019s all.* \n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. \n\nI pretended it was all a dream. \n\nPretending is what I\u2019m good at. \n\nPretending is all I\u2019ve got. \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014   \n \n\nThe film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. \n\nI told her she could send me pictures\u2014but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  \n\nShe agreed, and very few pictures were sent. \n\nAt work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. \n\nSometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I\u2019d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. \n\nI would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. \n\nIt just was what it was. \n\nI pretended it was normal. \n\nI knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. \n\nSo halfway through Becca\u2019s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOn the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. \n\nThere were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. \n\nWe introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. \n\nThe older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. \n\nThe younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my heart sank. \n\nI tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThey were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It\u2019s just plastic. It can\u2019t hurt me.* \n\n*There is no way I can give up on this class.* \n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d The younger instructor asked. \n\nI nodded quickly. \u201cYeah yeah, just trying them on.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Try opening our test file.\u201d \n\nOur computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010\u2019s dance hit. \n\nAs a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   \n   \nI scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn\u2019t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. \n\nIt was squealing.  \n\nAt first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn\u2019t stop.  \n\nThe instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. \n\nThe squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*\u201c Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn\u2014\u201d* \n\nI dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. \n\n\u201cYup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I\u2019m just\u2014I can handle it.\u201d   \n   \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\nThe teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there\u2019s no way she would. It must\u2019ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. \n\nI was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  \n\nI held my face and started to sob. I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u2014   \n \n[KONIEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)",

Tickets were expensive. \n\n\u2014 \n\nI met Becca\u2019s family. They were wonderful. \n\n\u2014 \n\nAfter months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90\u2019s shows, listening to new \u201cbest of\u201d playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  \n\nIt was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. \n\nIn truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: \u201cdas ist normal.\u201d \n\nTickets weren\u2019t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently\u2014the film was supposed to be good.  \n\nI was curious from a typical filmgoer\u2019s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* \n\nBy some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were \u2026 *strange*. It's like they\u2019re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* \n\nA tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this \u201cexquisite gem\u201d of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. \n\nI took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. \n\nSoon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  \n\nThen the movie started. \n\n\u2014 \n\nThe opening scene is loud. It\u2019s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don\u2019t know my medieval times)*.* We\u2019re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  \n\nA skewer goes through my stomach.  \n\nI\u2019m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon\u2019s dead body. \n\n*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* \n\nI exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  \n\n*It\u2019s just a movie. Just pretend it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s all you're here to see.* \n\nAfter a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie\u2019s plot. And to my surprise, I do. \n\nVery quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  \n\nIn subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, \u201cI would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.\u201d The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. \n\nAs luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet\u2014on one of the meat skewers. There\u2019s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom\u2019s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina\u2019s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  \n\nThe wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. \n\nThat night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m your new husband.\u201d \n\nPolina is of course scared. Confused. \u201cYou\u2019re my new husband?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.\u201d \n\nPolina\u2019s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil\u2019s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. \n\nThrough title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty \n\n\u201cWhy are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town\u2019s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. \n\nIn the morning, Polina\u2019s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. \u201cThe pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor\u2019s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig\u2019s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina\u2019s dead husband-to-be. \n\nPolina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. \n\nOn Polina\u2019s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. \u201cHe gets along well with the children,\u201d Polina explains. \n\nAlthough the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. \n\nBut the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  \n\n\u201cHow come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. \n\nShe leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  \n\n\u201cNow lay with me.\u201d The swine says.  \n\nTeeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that\u2019s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig\u2019s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. \n\n\u201cWrap an arm around me.\u201d \n\nPolina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. \n\n\u201cA wife must lay with her husband,\u201d The pig says. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will. Or your soul is mine.\u201d \n\nWithout much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig\u2019s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  \n\n\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d \n\nThe pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig\u2019s molars.  \n\nAt this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  \n\nIt is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  \n\nThey are about to kiss.  \n\nAre they actually going to?  \n\nThey do.  \n\nI hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. \n\n*\u201cMein Gott \u2026 \u201d* \n\n*\u201cWiderlich.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cIt must be fake \u2026 \u201d* \n\nBut it\u2019s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human\u2019s mouth like an over-excited dog. \n\nPolina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. \n\n\u201cKiss me! KISS ME!\u201d \n\nWhen I look back at the screen, Polina\u2019s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. \u201cThe Devil has my daughter!\u201d  \n\nThe pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. \n\nWe see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  \n\nFade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina\u2019s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. \n\nShe is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. \n\nWith nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. \n\nThe camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what\u2019s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds \u2026 she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. \n\nWhen we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I\u2019ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. \u201c*Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119? Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119?\u201d* \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo you are not.\u201d The pig\u2019s voice returns. \u201cYou have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.\u201d   \n   \nPolina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d She yells. \n\n\u201cYour soul is forfeit. It is mine.\u201d \n\nPolina takes her hands in her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. \n\nThere\u2019s squealing. Screaming. \n\n*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  \n\n\u201cAnd because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.\u201d \n\nSomething invisible takes a bite of Polina\u2019s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. \n\nThen the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. \n\nI feel a panic attack coming on. I can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can\u2019t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. \n\nI plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It\u2019s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. \n\n*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* \n\nBut then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. \n\nThis Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire \u2026 emerges a ten foot demon.  \n\nThe thing from hell. \n\nEveryone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. \n\nThe thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.\u201d Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. \u201cNo no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.\u201d \n\nI held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. \n\nEven now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. \n\nIt was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  \n\n*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* \n\nThe sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. \n\nNow here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time \u2026 mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. \n\nMy heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can\u2019t unsee it. I can\u2019t unhear it.  \n\nIt is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. \n\nThe screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. \n\n\u2014 \n\nWhen I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. \n\nI am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? \n\nI wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. \n\nI look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  \n\nThe applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. \n\nThe director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d  Olek says. \n\n\u2014   \n   \nCatharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nOn stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. \n\nAnd then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. \n\n\u201cWho did your cinematography? It was beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere did you find your actors? Unbelievable.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you pull off those VFX? How?\u201d \n\nSomething inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* \n\n*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* \n\nI was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? \n\n*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. \n\n\u201cMurderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!\u201d \n\nPatrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. \n\nI began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. \u201cAdrian Kowalski! Pawe\u0142 Nowak! Martyna Wi\u015bniewska! \u2026\u201d I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. \n\nA security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. \n\n\u201cPlease do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.\u201d \n\nI finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. \n\n\u201cShe is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,\u201d Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. \u201cA man named \u0141ukasz D\u0119browski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.\u201d He lifted his hand, \u201cI \u2026 was one of those students\u201d \n\nSharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*\u2019s. \n\n\u201cYes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.\u201d \n\nAudience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real \u0141ukasz actually found and arrested? \n\nBefore I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. \n\nJust another attention seeker. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOnce the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating\u2014I was trudging through molasses. \n\nTo make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. \n\nI did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn\u2019t just blow off my partner. \n\n\u201cAnna! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!\u201d \n\nI gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. \n\n\u201cWe should get a couple drinks!\u201d Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. \u201cEveryone\u2019s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!\u201d \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* \n\nSo despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn\u2019t want to be recognized as \u2018*that person at the Q&A*\u2019, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cCould you feel it in the room?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou mean, the energy? The magic?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!\u201d Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. \u201cThat was insane!\u201d \n\nI nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the guy?\u201d One of Becca\u2019s new friends asked. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy!\u201d Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. \u201cAnna, you\u2019ll never believe this, but I\u2019ve got some amazing news. You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d \n\nI knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets \u2026* \n\n\u201cIm shooting his next one. I\u2019m officially his next DP!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome!\u201d The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  \n\nThe information passed through me. It didn\u2019t register. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great Anna?\u201d Becca hovered her martini close to mine. \n\n\u201cIsn't what great?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shooting Olek\u2019s next movie. My first art house, I\u2019ve caught my big break!\u201d \n\nI stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s \u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know! Crazy right!\u201d She bumped my glass and took a big swig. \n\nI crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can\u2019t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You can never do it. Please don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  She indicated \u2018another round\u2019 to the bartender. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at the hotel.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnna, are you alright?\u201d \n\nI shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn\u2019t follow. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel?\u201d She called behind my back. I didn\u2019t reply.  \n\n\u2014 \n\nI was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can\u2019t be happening. There\u2019s no way any of this is real.* \n\nI bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. \n\nI wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. \n\nI closed my eyes. *You\u2019re gonna be okay. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re gonna be okay.* \n\nThen a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* \n\nWhen I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  \n\nOlek was in my room. \n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said. \n\nI stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. \n\nAnd yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. \n\n\u201cBerlin huh?\u201d \n\nI tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn\u2019t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. \n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the movie?\u201d \n\nI briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? \n\n\u201cYou know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.\u201d He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. \u201cDo you want me to fix it again?\u201d  \n\nIce cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. \u201cN-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.\u201d \n\nHe walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were the first one I\u2019ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?\u201d \n\nOutside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek\u2019s reflection. \u201cDo you like mercy?\u201d \n\nI cleared my throat. Nodded. \n\n\u201cGood. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her\u201d He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. \n\n\u201cSpeaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?\u201d \n\nMy eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn\u2019t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. \n\n\u201cI couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot \u2026 she\u2019s forever gone.\u201d \n\nHis dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. \n\n*Don\u2019t move. Remain steady. Don\u2019t show fear.* \n\n\u201cIt is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.\u201d \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. \n\nI pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. \n\n\u201cYou're within reach.\u201d Is all he eventually said.  \n\nThen he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  \n\nBut Olek wasn\u2019t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a party happening. An underground club. You\u2019re welcome to join if you want.\u201d \n\nI was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* \n\nHe seemed to be able to read my face. \n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d \n\nHe turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik\u2019s presence vanished down the hall. \n\nI ran over and shut everything\u2014applied all locks.  \n\nThen I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? \u2026 Do I \u2026 Did that \u2026 actually just happen?* \n\n*Am I dreaming?* \n\nI grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  \n\nBehind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything\u2019s wiped. This can\u2019t be happening. \n\nAfter a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  \n\n*I must have just woken up. That\u2019s all.* \n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. \n\nI pretended it was all a dream. \n\nPretending is what I\u2019m good at. \n\nPretending is all I\u2019ve got. \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014   \n \n\nThe film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. \n\nI told her she could send me pictures\u2014but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  \n\nShe agreed, and very few pictures were sent. \n\nAt work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. \n\nSometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I\u2019d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. \n\nI would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. \n\nIt just was what it was. \n\nI pretended it was normal. \n\nI knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. \n\nSo halfway through Becca\u2019s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOn the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. \n\nThere were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. \n\nWe introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. \n\nThe older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. \n\nThe younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my heart sank. \n\nI tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThey were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It\u2019s just plastic. It can\u2019t hurt me.* \n\n*There is no way I can give up on this class.* \n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d The younger instructor asked. \n\nI nodded quickly. \u201cYeah yeah, just trying them on.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Try opening our test file.\u201d \n\nOur computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010\u2019s dance hit. \n\nAs a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   \n   \nI scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn\u2019t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. \n\nIt was squealing.  \n\nAt first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn\u2019t stop.  \n\nThe instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. \n\nThe squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*\u201c Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn\u2014\u201d* \n\nI dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. \n\n\u201cYup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I\u2019m just\u2014I can handle it.\u201d   \n   \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\nThe teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there\u2019s no way she would. It must\u2019ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. \n\nI was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  \n\nI held my face and started to sob. I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u2014   \n \n[KONIEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)",

Tickets were expensive. \n\n\u2014 \n\nI met Becca\u2019s family. They were wonderful. \n\n\u2014 \n\nAfter months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90\u2019s shows, listening to new \u201cbest of\u201d playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  \n\nIt was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. \n\nIn truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: \u201cdas ist normal.\u201d \n\nTickets weren\u2019t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently\u2014the film was supposed to be good.  \n\nI was curious from a typical filmgoer\u2019s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* \n\nBy some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were \u2026 *strange*. It's like they\u2019re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* \n\nA tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this \u201cexquisite gem\u201d of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. \n\nI took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. \n\nSoon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  \n\nThen the movie started. \n\n\u2014 \n\nThe opening scene is loud. It\u2019s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don\u2019t know my medieval times)*.* We\u2019re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  \n\nA skewer goes through my stomach.  \n\nI\u2019m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon\u2019s dead body. \n\n*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* \n\nI exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  \n\n*It\u2019s just a movie. Just pretend it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s all you're here to see.* \n\nAfter a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie\u2019s plot. And to my surprise, I do. \n\nVery quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  \n\nIn subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, \u201cI would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.\u201d The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. \n\nAs luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet\u2014on one of the meat skewers. There\u2019s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom\u2019s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina\u2019s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  \n\nThe wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. \n\nThat night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m your new husband.\u201d \n\nPolina is of course scared. Confused. \u201cYou\u2019re my new husband?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.\u201d \n\nPolina\u2019s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil\u2019s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. \n\nThrough title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty \n\n\u201cWhy are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town\u2019s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. \n\nIn the morning, Polina\u2019s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. \u201cThe pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor\u2019s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig\u2019s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina\u2019s dead husband-to-be. \n\nPolina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. \n\nOn Polina\u2019s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. \u201cHe gets along well with the children,\u201d Polina explains. \n\nAlthough the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. \n\nBut the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  \n\n\u201cHow come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. \n\nShe leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  \n\n\u201cNow lay with me.\u201d The swine says.  \n\nTeeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that\u2019s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig\u2019s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. \n\n\u201cWrap an arm around me.\u201d \n\nPolina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. \n\n\u201cA wife must lay with her husband,\u201d The pig says. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will. Or your soul is mine.\u201d \n\nWithout much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig\u2019s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  \n\n\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d \n\nThe pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig\u2019s molars.  \n\nAt this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  \n\nIt is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  \n\nThey are about to kiss.  \n\nAre they actually going to?  \n\nThey do.  \n\nI hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. \n\n*\u201cMein Gott \u2026 \u201d* \n\n*\u201cWiderlich.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cIt must be fake \u2026 \u201d* \n\nBut it\u2019s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human\u2019s mouth like an over-excited dog. \n\nPolina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. \n\n\u201cKiss me! KISS ME!\u201d \n\nWhen I look back at the screen, Polina\u2019s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. \u201cThe Devil has my daughter!\u201d  \n\nThe pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. \n\nWe see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  \n\nFade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina\u2019s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. \n\nShe is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. \n\nWith nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. \n\nThe camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what\u2019s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds \u2026 she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. \n\nWhen we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I\u2019ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. \u201c*Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119? Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119?\u201d* \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo you are not.\u201d The pig\u2019s voice returns. \u201cYou have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.\u201d   \n   \nPolina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d She yells. \n\n\u201cYour soul is forfeit. It is mine.\u201d \n\nPolina takes her hands in her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. \n\nThere\u2019s squealing. Screaming. \n\n*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  \n\n\u201cAnd because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.\u201d \n\nSomething invisible takes a bite of Polina\u2019s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. \n\nThen the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. \n\nI feel a panic attack coming on. I can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can\u2019t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. \n\nI plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It\u2019s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. \n\n*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* \n\nBut then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. \n\nThis Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire \u2026 emerges a ten foot demon.  \n\nThe thing from hell. \n\nEveryone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. \n\nThe thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.\u201d Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. \u201cNo no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.\u201d \n\nI held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. \n\nEven now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. \n\nIt was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  \n\n*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* \n\nThe sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. \n\nNow here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time \u2026 mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. \n\nMy heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can\u2019t unsee it. I can\u2019t unhear it.  \n\nIt is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. \n\nThe screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. \n\n\u2014 \n\nWhen I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. \n\nI am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? \n\nI wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. \n\nI look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  \n\nThe applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. \n\nThe director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d  Olek says. \n\n\u2014   \n   \nCatharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nOn stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. \n\nAnd then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. \n\n\u201cWho did your cinematography? It was beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere did you find your actors? Unbelievable.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you pull off those VFX? How?\u201d \n\nSomething inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* \n\n*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* \n\nI was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? \n\n*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. \n\n\u201cMurderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!\u201d \n\nPatrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. \n\nI began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. \u201cAdrian Kowalski! Pawe\u0142 Nowak! Martyna Wi\u015bniewska! \u2026\u201d I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. \n\nA security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. \n\n\u201cPlease do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.\u201d \n\nI finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. \n\n\u201cShe is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,\u201d Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. \u201cA man named \u0141ukasz D\u0119browski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.\u201d He lifted his hand, \u201cI \u2026 was one of those students\u201d \n\nSharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*\u2019s. \n\n\u201cYes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.\u201d \n\nAudience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real \u0141ukasz actually found and arrested? \n\nBefore I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. \n\nJust another attention seeker. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOnce the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating\u2014I was trudging through molasses. \n\nTo make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. \n\nI did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn\u2019t just blow off my partner. \n\n\u201cAnna! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!\u201d \n\nI gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. \n\n\u201cWe should get a couple drinks!\u201d Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. \u201cEveryone\u2019s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!\u201d \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* \n\nSo despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn\u2019t want to be recognized as \u2018*that person at the Q&A*\u2019, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cCould you feel it in the room?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou mean, the energy? The magic?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!\u201d Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. \u201cThat was insane!\u201d \n\nI nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the guy?\u201d One of Becca\u2019s new friends asked. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy!\u201d Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. \u201cAnna, you\u2019ll never believe this, but I\u2019ve got some amazing news. You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d \n\nI knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets \u2026* \n\n\u201cIm shooting his next one. I\u2019m officially his next DP!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome!\u201d The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  \n\nThe information passed through me. It didn\u2019t register. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great Anna?\u201d Becca hovered her martini close to mine. \n\n\u201cIsn't what great?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shooting Olek\u2019s next movie. My first art house, I\u2019ve caught my big break!\u201d \n\nI stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s \u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know! Crazy right!\u201d She bumped my glass and took a big swig. \n\nI crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can\u2019t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You can never do it. Please don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  She indicated \u2018another round\u2019 to the bartender. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at the hotel.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnna, are you alright?\u201d \n\nI shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn\u2019t follow. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel?\u201d She called behind my back. I didn\u2019t reply.  \n\n\u2014 \n\nI was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can\u2019t be happening. There\u2019s no way any of this is real.* \n\nI bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. \n\nI wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. \n\nI closed my eyes. *You\u2019re gonna be okay. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re gonna be okay.* \n\nThen a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* \n\nWhen I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  \n\nOlek was in my room. \n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said. \n\nI stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. \n\nAnd yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. \n\n\u201cBerlin huh?\u201d \n\nI tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn\u2019t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. \n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the movie?\u201d \n\nI briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? \n\n\u201cYou know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.\u201d He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. \u201cDo you want me to fix it again?\u201d  \n\nIce cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. \u201cN-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.\u201d \n\nHe walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were the first one I\u2019ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?\u201d \n\nOutside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek\u2019s reflection. \u201cDo you like mercy?\u201d \n\nI cleared my throat. Nodded. \n\n\u201cGood. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her\u201d He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. \n\n\u201cSpeaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?\u201d \n\nMy eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn\u2019t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. \n\n\u201cI couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot \u2026 she\u2019s forever gone.\u201d \n\nHis dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. \n\n*Don\u2019t move. Remain steady. Don\u2019t show fear.* \n\n\u201cIt is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.\u201d \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. \n\nI pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. \n\n\u201cYou're within reach.\u201d Is all he eventually said.  \n\nThen he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  \n\nBut Olek wasn\u2019t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a party happening. An underground club. You\u2019re welcome to join if you want.\u201d \n\nI was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* \n\nHe seemed to be able to read my face. \n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d \n\nHe turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik\u2019s presence vanished down the hall. \n\nI ran over and shut everything\u2014applied all locks.  \n\nThen I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? \u2026 Do I \u2026 Did that \u2026 actually just happen?* \n\n*Am I dreaming?* \n\nI grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  \n\nBehind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything\u2019s wiped. This can\u2019t be happening. \n\nAfter a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  \n\n*I must have just woken up. That\u2019s all.* \n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. \n\nI pretended it was all a dream. \n\nPretending is what I\u2019m good at. \n\nPretending is all I\u2019ve got. \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014   \n \n\nThe film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. \n\nI told her she could send me pictures\u2014but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  \n\nShe agreed, and very few pictures were sent. \n\nAt work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. \n\nSometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I\u2019d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. \n\nI would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. \n\nIt just was what it was. \n\nI pretended it was normal. \n\nI knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. \n\nSo halfway through Becca\u2019s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOn the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. \n\nThere were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. \n\nWe introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. \n\nThe older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. \n\nThe younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my heart sank. \n\nI tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThey were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It\u2019s just plastic. It can\u2019t hurt me.* \n\n*There is no way I can give up on this class.* \n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d The younger instructor asked. \n\nI nodded quickly. \u201cYeah yeah, just trying them on.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Try opening our test file.\u201d \n\nOur computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010\u2019s dance hit. \n\nAs a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   \n   \nI scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn\u2019t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. \n\nIt was squealing.  \n\nAt first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn\u2019t stop.  \n\nThe instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. \n\nThe squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*\u201c Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn\u2014\u201d* \n\nI dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. \n\n\u201cYup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I\u2019m just\u2014I can handle it.\u201d   \n   \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\nThe teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there\u2019s no way she would. It must\u2019ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. \n\nI was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  \n\nI held my face and started to sob. I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u2014   \n \n[KONIEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)",

        "selftext": "You will never be a real cuirassier. You have no heavy sword, you have no dumbass hat, you have no white uniform. You are a heavy cavalry twisted by self hatred and b&i wiki into a crude mockery of nature\u2019s perfection.\n\nAll the \u201cvalidation\u201d you get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back people mock you. Your teammates are disgusted and ashamed of you, your \u201cfriends\u201d laugh at your unsophisticated appearance behind closed barn doors.\n\nInfantry are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed footmen to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. Even cuirassiers who \u201cpass\u201d look uncanny and unnatural to an infantry. Your hat is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a rifleman on your horse, he\u2019ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your hidden pistol's gunpowder.\n\nYou will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it\u2019s going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.\n\nEventually it\u2019ll be too much to bear - you\u2019ll go to the bridge of arcole, take your clothes off noose, and plunge into the cum river. Your fellow cavalrymen will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to share a barracks with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They\u2019ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth class, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a heavy cavalry is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably a heavy cavlry.\n\nThis is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back.",

        "selftext": "I'm going over this list because I'll admit I have a lot of free time (no. i'm just wasting my time!) Did we already review this? If we did then my badsies! Here we go... (it would've been much easier if it were numbered smh)\n\n[List of Jeremiah's 'Red Flags'](https://preview.redd.it/tw7uaayrbtqc1.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=885371159117dff0623d5214f5bad66128280a5d)\n\n1. This 16 year old boy just found out that his mom died. He literally found out by himself alone. He thought he was going to start an official relationship with this girl he really liked. He loves. Just to find out that while HE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT RESEARCHING FOR HIS MOM'S TREATMENT, this girl that he loves was busy kissing some other boy she's been infatuated with all her life at the beach and smiles while she breaks this news to him. She wasn't even caring for Jere. She was just with Conrad. (in her defense, i'd say it's good that they got together bc that's her long time crush and she finally had her chance... but bad timing. At least she puts a pause while Conrad's like no... Jere's not serious.)\n2. The boy was jealous. We all have our jealous moments. But most importantly... he wasn't trying to kill his brother and the girl he likes. How will he have a chance with her if he killed her? LBR. Also she specifically mentions that she wants to be with someone who gives her fireworks. That's what Jeremiah does. He delivered it. But also, the firework was like hundreds of feet away from them. Want to do a rewatch? Feel free to DM me.\n3. How does he undermine Conrad? He only states facts. What he believes because it's true. He literally looked up to his big brother his whole life. Now he sees him for who he really is. A coward :D\n4. He has nothing to offer Belly? Just because he's not her long time crush, doesn't mean he doesn't have anything to offer her. HE IS REAL. HE IS HER BEST FRIEND. HE MAKES TIME FOR HER. HE LOVES HER. HE BOOSTS HER SELF CONFIDENCE WITH WORDS OF AFFIRMATIONS. EVEN WHEN HE'S UPSET, HE'S THERE FOR HER. HE NEVER UNDERMINES HER. DOESN'T EVER BRING UP HER DEEPEST INSECURITIES. HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE BELLY HAPPY. HE TREATS HER SO WELL. HE'S SO HUSBAND MATERIAL. HE'S A TOTAL GREEN FLAG IF ANYTHING. SHE CHOOSES HIM EVERY TIME. He doesn't want to win her or own her..? That's Conrad.. He's the competitive one according to Belly. He always throws infinity in front of her face to make sure she comes running back. Conrad's the one who called Belly 'my girl' in Book 3 when they were NEVER together officially and JEREMIAH was engaged to her. Also Jere said he just wants her to be happy. He was expecting her to choose Conrad again. Jeremiah doesn't want to beat Conrad. He's not even the competitive type. There's no point of beating Conrad anyway. Pull up the wrestling chapter in Book 2. (What page you may ask? I forgot. Go find it yourself, respectfully :D). Also if he wanted to beat Conrad, he would've ran after Nicole as well. He would've been super studious and went to Brown or Stanford. He literally doesn't ruin her life. He makes her happy. He never made her cry like someone else does.\n5. Okay so this is the books. This hasn't even happened in the show. He hooks up with another girl while Belly and him were \\*BROKEN UP\\*. Yeah so what happens in Cabo stays in Cabo. He says \"I won\u2019t waste your time anymore. Let\u2019s end it now.\" and she says \"Fine.\" so yeah. Then after that he hooks up with Lacie. He NEVER intended to get back together with her. SHE went to him to apologize first. He probably should've told her but he loved her and he had the chance to get back with her. He wasn't going to mess up again by telling her about Cabo. He knew that it was going to hurt her and that he might lose her again. He wasn't going to risk it. So after he wants to marry her because he wants to show that he's committed to her and that he doesn't want to break her trust ever again.\n6. It was NOT a 'fake temporary break'. It was a \\*break up\\*. They were broken up. He wasn't going to handle her undermining him and telling him about how stupid his fraternity was. How much better Conrad is than him. She doesn't even like him having other activities either like playing soccer. He called it off and he didn't even do anything wrong in that argument. He just told her how he was leaving to Cabo. She kept bringing all his insecurities upon him. What's wrong with rebound sex? He hasn't even had sex in a long time. He was sexually repressed. He was also probably drunk. He is single too. Is it problematic to hook up with someone while you're single?\n7. When was constantly? Literally the only time he mentions it was at that party scene. They were all wasted. Conrad was also moping around the entire last summer because their mother was dying even though she wanted the best summer ever and he didn't give it to her.\n8. He wasn't trying to shame her. He was heartbroken because of her. He was also just stating the truth. Why get mad over the truth?\n9. Conrad doesn't even communicate anyway. That was the only time. Why did Conrad go to their house just to beg for his blessing? 'Oh my chest physically hurts to not tell her I'm in love with her...' Boy... your chest must still be hurting. When is it going to explode? Anytime soon? And then he leaves when he gets what he wants? Did he not realize that their mom was dying and all he cares about is being with a 16 year old girl? He LIED to Belly that Jere was on a high just so he could date her (and bribes her with candy.) He never went behind Conrad's back about it. Belly wanted Jeremiah. You can't control feelings you have for someone.\n10. Not being home enough? YEAH HE WASN'T HOME ENOUGH. Your mom is dying. Your house is ***45 minutes away*** from school. You have time to come home like every day. YOU COULD EVEN LIVE AT HOME. You're almost always at this 16 year old girl's house which is **5 hours away** from your school so you have no problem driving but you can't come home?!? TO VISIT YOUR MOM!??! WHO'S ON HER DEATH BED?!?? You were literally moping around all last summer because your mom's dying. Also he's the Ivy League kid who only knows how to say 'grow up'.\n11. He was in shock. I would've been too. Like he literally loves that place so much. How could he believe that. NOT BELIEVING CONRAD?? THAT ISN'T A RED FLAG-\n12. He called Conrad so many times and he never picked up. Obviously Conrad had his phone because he texted Trusky about the notes. He was literally worried sick for him and drove everywhere just to find him. It could've all been preventable if CONRAD PICKED UP THE FIRST TIME.\n13. Just like Conrad wasn't concerned when Jere was missing at the deb ball. But anyway... I'm being petty. Just let Jere relax. He had a rough senior year. He was toooo serious. It was late at night. Also he texted Conrad's friends and contacts. He wasn't going to do a whole mystery search around the whole East Coast like... Conrad is an *adult*. He can look after himself.\n14. Oh so this is when you finally use Susannah's name. Conrad was being a dick. Jere didn't mean it. They literally made up the next day. Also in the books (that the other side so desperately loves.. it's Conrad who brings up Belly's name :D)\n15. Possessive how? I don't even know what to say.\n16. Wasn't this just mentioned in another point??? Just admit that he has nowhere as many red flags as Conrad Fisher does.\n17. He was setting boundaries like a normal person would do. He was hurt too. He had a lot going on. His mom was dying. That's literally the only time Conrad cares about Belly too like.\n18. Conrad makes the first punch in the book. Jeremiah punches him in Book 3 because Conrad was trying to get in the way of Bellyjere THE DAY OF THEIR WEDDING. Like that's messed up especially when you're his brother. Jeremiah punches him in the end of S1 because Conrad knew about the cancer and never told him. Conrad literally gaslit him when Jere tries to ask him earlier in S1 about their mom. Yeah Conrad didn't have to tell him about the cancer but he should've at least mentioned to their mom about it or at least anything but gaslighting him. Also just goes to show how strong Jeremiah Fisher is. Belly loves strong men! (and so do I :D)\n19. Everyone loves Conrad. Jere had no one when his mom was dying like no one put him first. Belly, Steven, Laurel, and the rest all left him. Although me personally I don't get why someone so gorgeous needs to be jealous of y'know Conrad. (I think this is primarily Adam's fault because he only ever praised Conrad and ignored Jere all his life.)\n20. This is Conrad. (I could make a list but I need to BeAsleep! And I guess he isn't *that* bad just like super annoying for godknowswhy but then again, I'm trying to defend JF here :D)\n21. Conrad too. Last summer. And this summer when he ran away from school.\n22. He never 'cussed her out'. He was just upset that she wasn't there. She admitted it too that she forgot about him and that it was 'Conrad this, Conrad that.'\n23. Well yeah it was the holidays. Conrad was ruining the mood like always. Jere throwing mud was literally just a sibling thing. It ain that deep.\n\nPhew! I'm done! I've def given up towards the end. This is a waste of time for sure and TBH not that deep at all but anyway feel free to add more :D",

I feel like most Bonrads are very confused and potentially justifying Conrad's behaviour because they see him as a stand-in for some very toxic relationship in their own lives which they are unable to get rid of.\n\nSecond, having read too many subs on the main, I also think a lot of people are threatened by own communication and see it as 'cussing out' rather than a healthy way to resolve differences. So they interpret Conrad's silence and stonewalling as 'being gentle' rather than seeing the other ways in which he deliberately hurts people.",

I bet as a child dogs would bark at her and she would bark back. She\u2019s like a ball of energy might be one of the fastest pgs I\u2019ve ever seen. Facilitator, playmaker and a great scorer not to mention she\u2019s gonna fly around and get every steal possible.\n\n\nMilaysia fulwiley\u2014 plays like she used to practice crazy ass moves in her driveway for hours until her momma made her come inside cause it was dark. Insane finishing, crazy handles can shoot the ball deep and has the ability to make flashy passes.\n\n\nJuju Watkins- I\u2019ve been waiting so long to find someone that plays like my favorite Carmelo Anthony. Finally somebody plays identical. too many wannabe Kobe clones in all levels of basketball men and women. Juju goes at her own pace she so smooth. Pull up jumpers, fade aways, pump fakes. I watched her jab step yesterday before a shot and it was almost enough to make a 24 year old man cry. \ud83d\ude2d(elite hoops)\n\n\nKiki iriafen-baby a\u2019ja.\n\n with her motor she\u2019s gonna get you 30-35 easy. She\u2019s long you can\u2019t contest her she can put the ball down and drive. She can post up or pull up it don\u2019t matter. She so long any shot in her vicinity good as blocked.\n\n\nMadison booker- \n\nThe point forward position is slowly but surely coming along finally! She so versatile she changes her position everytime I look up. Oh she running pg oh now she at 2 guard. Damn now she\u2019s at power forward.\n\n I think we are just getting started with how elite women\u2019s college hoops is about to be.",

I certainly believe it is contributing to the injuries of more players.\n\nBut that same grind gets these young ladies ready for the bigger stage.",

Now im an adult and figuring this all out on my own. My psychiatrist suspects i have OCD and BPD along with generalized anxiety, i am not officially diagnosed yet. I would have never suspected OCD as i had a very narrow view on what it meant (what is portrayed in the media; obsessive cleaning, counting,etc). As i am doing more research i find myself aligning with a lot of OCD symptoms specifically thought loops about people hating me, playing out fake arguments in my head, believing deep down i am inherently an evil person, etc. I have found most of these symptoms overlap with BPD so i was finding it hard to differentiate the two. I find my BPD apparent after i\u2019ve been stuck in a thought loop and effectively convinced myself said person hates me, then my emotions explode and i will split on them. After i calm down i am deeply embarrassed of my actions and i feel it valides the feeling of being a burden to everyone around me. I am very curious if anyone has insight on OCD and BPD together and if the overlapping symptoms makes any sense? ",

Tickets were expensive. \n\n\u2014 \n\nI met Becca\u2019s family. They were wonderful. \n\n\u2014 \n\nAfter months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90\u2019s shows, listening to new \u201cbest of\u201d playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  \n\nIt was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. \n\nIn truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: \u201cdas ist normal.\u201d \n\nTickets weren\u2019t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently\u2014the film was supposed to be good.  \n\nI was curious from a typical filmgoer\u2019s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* \n\nBy some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were \u2026 *strange*. It's like they\u2019re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* \n\nA tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this \u201cexquisite gem\u201d of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. \n\nI took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. \n\nSoon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  \n\nThen the movie started. \n\n\u2014 \n\nThe opening scene is loud. It\u2019s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don\u2019t know my medieval times)*.* We\u2019re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  \n\nA skewer goes through my stomach.  \n\nI\u2019m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon\u2019s dead body. \n\n*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* \n\nI exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  \n\n*It\u2019s just a movie. Just pretend it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s all you're here to see.* \n\nAfter a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie\u2019s plot. And to my surprise, I do. \n\nVery quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  \n\nIn subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, \u201cI would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.\u201d The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. \n\nAs luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet\u2014on one of the meat skewers. There\u2019s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom\u2019s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina\u2019s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  \n\nThe wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. \n\nThat night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m your new husband.\u201d \n\nPolina is of course scared. Confused. \u201cYou\u2019re my new husband?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.\u201d \n\nPolina\u2019s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil\u2019s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. \n\nThrough title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty \n\n\u201cWhy are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town\u2019s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. \n\nIn the morning, Polina\u2019s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. \u201cThe pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor\u2019s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig\u2019s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina\u2019s dead husband-to-be. \n\nPolina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. \n\nOn Polina\u2019s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. \u201cHe gets along well with the children,\u201d Polina explains. \n\nAlthough the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. \n\nBut the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  \n\n\u201cHow come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. \n\nShe leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  \n\n\u201cNow lay with me.\u201d The swine says.  \n\nTeeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that\u2019s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig\u2019s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. \n\n\u201cWrap an arm around me.\u201d \n\nPolina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. \n\n\u201cA wife must lay with her husband,\u201d The pig says. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will. Or your soul is mine.\u201d \n\nWithout much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig\u2019s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  \n\n\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d \n\nThe pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig\u2019s molars.  \n\nAt this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  \n\nIt is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  \n\nThey are about to kiss.  \n\nAre they actually going to?  \n\nThey do.  \n\nI hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. \n\n*\u201cMein Gott \u2026 \u201d* \n\n*\u201cWiderlich.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cIt must be fake \u2026 \u201d* \n\nBut it\u2019s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human\u2019s mouth like an over-excited dog. \n\nPolina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. \n\n\u201cKiss me! KISS ME!\u201d \n\nWhen I look back at the screen, Polina\u2019s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. \u201cThe Devil has my daughter!\u201d  \n\nThe pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. \n\nWe see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  \n\nFade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina\u2019s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. \n\nShe is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. \n\nWith nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. \n\nThe camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what\u2019s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds \u2026 she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. \n\nWhen we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I\u2019ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. \u201c*Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119? Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119?\u201d* \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo you are not.\u201d The pig\u2019s voice returns. \u201cYou have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.\u201d   \n   \nPolina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d She yells. \n\n\u201cYour soul is forfeit. It is mine.\u201d \n\nPolina takes her hands in her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. \n\nThere\u2019s squealing. Screaming. \n\n*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  \n\n\u201cAnd because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.\u201d \n\nSomething invisible takes a bite of Polina\u2019s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. \n\nThen the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. \n\nI feel a panic attack coming on. I can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can\u2019t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. \n\nI plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It\u2019s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. \n\n*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* \n\nBut then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. \n\nThis Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire \u2026 emerges a ten foot demon.  \n\nThe thing from hell. \n\nEveryone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. \n\nThe thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.\u201d Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. \u201cNo no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.\u201d \n\nI held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. \n\nEven now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. \n\nIt was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  \n\n*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* \n\nThe sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. \n\nNow here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time \u2026 mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. \n\nMy heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can\u2019t unsee it. I can\u2019t unhear it.  \n\nIt is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. \n\nThe screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. \n\n\u2014 \n\nWhen I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. \n\nI am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? \n\nI wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. \n\nI look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  \n\nThe applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. \n\nThe director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d  Olek says. \n\n\u2014   \n   \nCatharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nOn stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. \n\nAnd then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. \n\n\u201cWho did your cinematography? It was beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere did you find your actors? Unbelievable.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you pull off those VFX? How?\u201d \n\nSomething inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* \n\n*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* \n\nI was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? \n\n*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. \n\n\u201cMurderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!\u201d \n\nPatrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. \n\nI began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. \u201cAdrian Kowalski! Pawe\u0142 Nowak! Martyna Wi\u015bniewska! \u2026\u201d I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. \n\nA security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. \n\n\u201cPlease do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.\u201d \n\nI finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. \n\n\u201cShe is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,\u201d Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. \u201cA man named \u0141ukasz D\u0119browski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.\u201d He lifted his hand, \u201cI \u2026 was one of those students\u201d \n\nSharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*\u2019s. \n\n\u201cYes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.\u201d \n\nAudience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real \u0141ukasz actually found and arrested? \n\nBefore I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. \n\nJust another attention seeker. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOnce the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating\u2014I was trudging through molasses. \n\nTo make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. \n\nI did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn\u2019t just blow off my partner. \n\n\u201cAnna! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!\u201d \n\nI gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. \n\n\u201cWe should get a couple drinks!\u201d Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. \u201cEveryone\u2019s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!\u201d \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* \n\nSo despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn\u2019t want to be recognized as \u2018*that person at the Q&A*\u2019, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cCould you feel it in the room?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou mean, the energy? The magic?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!\u201d Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. \u201cThat was insane!\u201d \n\nI nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the guy?\u201d One of Becca\u2019s new friends asked. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy!\u201d Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. \u201cAnna, you\u2019ll never believe this, but I\u2019ve got some amazing news. You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d \n\nI knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets \u2026* \n\n\u201cIm shooting his next one. I\u2019m officially his next DP!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome!\u201d The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  \n\nThe information passed through me. It didn\u2019t register. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great Anna?\u201d Becca hovered her martini close to mine. \n\n\u201cIsn't what great?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shooting Olek\u2019s next movie. My first art house, I\u2019ve caught my big break!\u201d \n\nI stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s \u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know! Crazy right!\u201d She bumped my glass and took a big swig. \n\nI crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can\u2019t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You can never do it. Please don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  She indicated \u2018another round\u2019 to the bartender. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at the hotel.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnna, are you alright?\u201d \n\nI shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn\u2019t follow. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel?\u201d She called behind my back. I didn\u2019t reply.  \n\n\u2014 \n\nI was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can\u2019t be happening. There\u2019s no way any of this is real.* \n\nI bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. \n\nI wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. \n\nI closed my eyes. *You\u2019re gonna be okay. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re gonna be okay.* \n\nThen a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* \n\nWhen I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  \n\nOlek was in my room. \n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said. \n\nI stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. \n\nAnd yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. \n\n\u201cBerlin huh?\u201d \n\nI tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn\u2019t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. \n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the movie?\u201d \n\nI briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? \n\n\u201cYou know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.\u201d He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. \u201cDo you want me to fix it again?\u201d  \n\nIce cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. \u201cN-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.\u201d \n\nHe walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were the first one I\u2019ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?\u201d \n\nOutside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek\u2019s reflection. \u201cDo you like mercy?\u201d \n\nI cleared my throat. Nodded. \n\n\u201cGood. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her\u201d He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. \n\n\u201cSpeaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?\u201d \n\nMy eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn\u2019t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. \n\n\u201cI couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot \u2026 she\u2019s forever gone.\u201d \n\nHis dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. \n\n*Don\u2019t move. Remain steady. Don\u2019t show fear.* \n\n\u201cIt is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.\u201d \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. \n\nI pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. \n\n\u201cYou're within reach.\u201d Is all he eventually said.  \n\nThen he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  \n\nBut Olek wasn\u2019t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a party happening. An underground club. You\u2019re welcome to join if you want.\u201d \n\nI was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* \n\nHe seemed to be able to read my face. \n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d \n\nHe turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik\u2019s presence vanished down the hall. \n\nI ran over and shut everything\u2014applied all locks.  \n\nThen I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? \u2026 Do I \u2026 Did that \u2026 actually just happen?* \n\n*Am I dreaming?* \n\nI grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  \n\nBehind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything\u2019s wiped. This can\u2019t be happening. \n\nAfter a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  \n\n*I must have just woken up. That\u2019s all.* \n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. \n\nI pretended it was all a dream. \n\nPretending is what I\u2019m good at. \n\nPretending is all I\u2019ve got. \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014   \n \n\nThe film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. \n\nI told her she could send me pictures\u2014but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  \n\nShe agreed, and very few pictures were sent. \n\nAt work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. \n\nSometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I\u2019d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. \n\nI would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. \n\nIt just was what it was. \n\nI pretended it was normal. \n\nI knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. \n\nSo halfway through Becca\u2019s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOn the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. \n\nThere were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. \n\nWe introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. \n\nThe older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. \n\nThe younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my heart sank. \n\nI tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThey were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It\u2019s just plastic. It can\u2019t hurt me.* \n\n*There is no way I can give up on this class.* \n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d The younger instructor asked. \n\nI nodded quickly. \u201cYeah yeah, just trying them on.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Try opening our test file.\u201d \n\nOur computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010\u2019s dance hit. \n\nAs a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   \n   \nI scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn\u2019t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. \n\nIt was squealing.  \n\nAt first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn\u2019t stop.  \n\nThe instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. \n\nThe squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*\u201c Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn\u2014\u201d* \n\nI dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. \n\n\u201cYup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I\u2019m just\u2014I can handle it.\u201d   \n   \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\nThe teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there\u2019s no way she would. It must\u2019ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. \n\nI was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  \n\nI held my face and started to sob. I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u2014   \n \n[KONIEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)",

I like to try my best to listen and evolve, find out what things I previously learned need updating or stand out in a new light. \n\nAll that pretentious bullshit aside, I am a pretty relaxed guy in the Ohio/Mich/Indiana area. I've had a ridiculously busy and full life for a person of my relatively few years and have become kind of a jack of all (mostly impractical but interesting) trades.\n\nI used to say I was a left leaning moderate until whatever happened in the last decade redefined that as far left. That being said, I here for open mindedness. If you're an extremist of any kind, you're probably not going to enjoy talking to me. \n\nI don't know what else really to say other than the fact that I think hobbies and small talk are fine but I definitely want to dive into the deep conversations and take the time to get to know someone before worrying about meeting or something IRL, but I would like to talk to someone where that's actually a realistic possibility. \n\n(Btw, as a means of screening against fakes that don't have time to read a post like this, tell me what you think about sleeping with a fan on)\n\n(Also, I notice scammers seem to want to rush into compliments and demanding photos and personal details upfront, so if you don't mind, I'm going to take a fair bit of time.)

There is no point in stalling.\"\n\n\"She is... unstable right now.\"\n\n\"I am going to be unstable if you do not do what I ask, Phoebe. This isn't hard.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nIzkrala minded her abdomen as she hooked into all her virtual reality equipment. She let the helmet descend upon her, and soon she was in the virtual reality for real. Though its artificiality was so clear all she needed to do was pay attention to her antennae. The air had no smell to it like it should.\n\nEventually, the meeting opened.\n\n\"Hello,\" Penny said, bowing slightly. \"I did not know I was going to meet you today.\"\n\n\"No, you did not,\" Izkrala said. \"That is why I arranged the meeting like this. I am, as you might remember, the Empress of the Acuarfar. I happened to watch the Lurave Empire fall to the Reaper Virus, propagated by the Sprilnav. And now I hear tales that are certainly stunning.\"\n\n\"I am well aware of what and who you are, Empress,\" Penny replied. Her gaze moved downward. \"And I understand how my actions might have vexed you.\"\n\n\"You prattle around Justicar, freeing slaves as you wish. A good thing. An argument in the sky with Nova, a Progenitor who most of their Elders idolize? A battle with a Grand Fleet? Two bad things. Would you wish to explain why you decided to endanger the Alliance with such actions?\"\n\n\"It was not entirely a decision. I am grieving, and there is a certain level of irrationality to that.\"\n\n\"I would accept that answer from most people. But Penny, you are the sole human envoy in all of Sprilnav space, and more powerful than the entire species put together. You cannot act like this. I do not care how you feel about my words. You need to hear them. If your anti-authoritarian streak flows too quickly, the Sprilnav will punish you by punishing us. And the only way they can punish us currently is with the Judgment. You know, the one where they will decide whether or not to kill us all.\"\n\nPenny sighed. Izkrala's anger grew at the dismissive gesture, but she didn't have an outburst. She needed to appear credible in the human's eyes. Shouting about responsibility and her duty to her people in the face of all other influences might serve Izkrala some catharsis. But it would ensure that Penny disregarded her advice, cold but required as it was. An Empress was above such things.\n\n\"Shall I inquire what that sigh was meant as?\"\n\n\"Do you ask for honesty, Empress?\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"Then do not be offended. But I have spent the past week hearing people talk at me, saying that 'this is right' and 'this is wrong' as if I have personally transgressed against them all. They have conflicting demands, and all want me to do something different than what I am doing. These are not the complaints of some girl who is unwilling to live up to responsibility. They are the complaints of the human who is struggling under the heaviest responsibilities in history, while being subject to constant emotional stress through the Judgments, Nova, and Yasihaut. Nilnacrawla is either dead or kidnapped, by the way. So I've lost my father, too. To me, your voice, while more trusted and representative of the Alliance than many others, is still just that. Your voice. It does not soothe me, it tires me. Because I am tired of being told what to do before I have even decided what I can do.\"\n\n\"All of the Alliance is at stake, Penny. Get over it. And I know how terrible that sounds. I lost one of my Emperors too, and I know what grief is. My parents are dead. Your adoptive Sprilnav father is not, because he is too valuable as a prisoner and a tool to manipulate you. But while important to you, he is one person. Love breaks all boundaries, and defies all definitions. But the Sprilnav will force you to choose between Earth and Nilnacrawla if they can.\"\n\n\"I know that, Izkrala. Why do you think I'm so upset?\"\n\n\"I would be careful about that anger. Save it for a target more worthy than I.\"\n\nIzkrala understood what Phoebe meant. Penny was definitely more irritable than normal.\n\n\"You call in the middle of the night, Izkrala. Interrupt one of my five hour sleeping cycles. And then complain. You are an Empress, but I am not an Acuarfar, nor one of your subjects. Perhaps you see my actions as wayward outbursts of a child to be corrected. But I am a person. Not a punching bag. If you have something useful to say, then say it.\"\n\n\"What I have said is useful, but it seems you are unwilling to agree.\"\n\n\"Another word for those last three is that I disagree, Izkrala.\"\n\nHer tone was growing more and more disrespectful. Still, Izkrala would give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"Yes. A fine observation. So my original plan was to pull you over to my view. Seeing as that will not work, I will ask you for yours. What do you think is the best action to take in your situation?\"  \n\"I stop listening to people yap at me about my decisions, and make my choices based on the advice I have already received, after deep consideration of the merits. I determine a way to handle the trap that Yasihaut has set for me, and also to do so in a way that avoids worsening the Judgment. I work out my anger, somehow, so that I can function in something approaching top shape. If possible, but certainly improbable, I get Nilnacrawla rescued.\"\n\nIzkrala smiled. \"I am sorry for doubting you, Penny.\"\n\n\"I appreciate the apology,\" Penny said honestly, giving her a deferential nod. \"I know that this isn't the same. But... woman to woman, how do you deal with this? The responsibility of it all?\"\n\nIzkrala pondered the words.\n\n\"That is difficult to answer. And likely requires more thought and time for a satisfactory one. However, I take things once piece at a time. Not one day at a time, one piece. So if there is a local political action group griping about 'freedom' in a bill I am about to sign, I determine whether to do a press release about it, ignore them, or have someone meet with them to find out their concerns.\n\nAnd after assessment, then I take action. Perhaps all the other problems pile on or get worse. But solving a bit of everything at a time is not the way I do things, when I have to get involved at all. It is like going to a restaurant. I can sample everything, spending a month to eventually finish all the meals at once, or I can eat a meal at a time. The end result is the same, except that some of the problems get solved before that deadline. Massive, complex problems I do my best to delegate.\n\nAn example of those would be the remaining unification issues between the Frawdar and Muscar Empires. I recognise that many Frawdar Acuarfar hold deep-seated doubt about my ability to lead them in a way that is beneficial for them. In the same way, I worry about rebellions there more. For you? As I have been briefed, you have a select number of problems. The gangs. The Judgment. Nilnacrawla. Yasihaut. Nova. Filnatra and Arneladia. And the freed slaves. Am I correct?\"\n\n\"Pretty much.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, I can offer opinions and advice on each,\" Izkrala said. \"But I will ask first. Do you honestly want my advice and opinions? If so, would you value them more from the Empress of the Acuarfar or as those of Fha Charn Izkrala, just another overworked and overstressed woman?\"\n\n\"The latter,\" Penny said. \"And good job.\"\n\n\"Good job?\"\n\n\"Showing that you actually care.\"\n\n\"I will be a mother soon,\" Izkrala said, thinking fondly of her own hidden eggs. Sprilnav attempts at destroying them had petered out. It was an attempt to lull her into a false sense of security, so Izkrala didn't take it. The bloodline would be protected, no matter how much it hurt that she couldn't see them so often. \"So it is important that I learn how.\"\n\n\"You know, Izkrala? You'd make a great human.\"\n\n\"Considering that my abdomen alone is larger than you are, I doubt the veracity of that statement.\"\n\nPenny raised a brow. \"Veracity? Really?\"\n\n\"It most certainly seems to be quite an apt descriptor. Or do you not adequately appreciate my unmatched grasp of impeccable verbiage?\"\n\nIzkrala's toothy grin loosened Penny up a bit.\n\n\"All you need is a British accent to complete the look.\"\n\n\"British? Like those islands in Europe?\"\n\n\"Yeah, probably,\" Penny laughed. \"Not big on Earth geography classes, huh?\"\n\n\"I learn what I need to when I need to. Such as the art of deflecting a conversation from its original purpose of discussion.\"\n\nPenny nodded. \"Point taken. I'd like your advice as Fha Charn Izkrala, then. About Yasihaut and Nilnacrawla. Yasihaut more, though. I know that I have a more visceral reaction to her than you did to Quaqualis or that other guy for the Lurave Empire.\"\n\n\"I admit that our relationship is not as unique and intimate as rivals, nor was it back then. Yasihaut has left deep scars on your psyche, and I fear that you and Nilnacrawla used each other as coping mechanisms as well as father and daughter partners.\"\n\nPenny frowned, but didn't say anything.\n\n\"As for Yasihaut, you are in danger of becoming *too* fixated on revenge to do what you know you need to do. You've probably heard this a bunch of times. But I'm going to tell you. She will set a trap. Azeri is irrelevant. To you, the anger is at Yasihaut. And she knows that, and knows you love Nilnacrawla. She will want to taunt you. Deepfakes of torture. Recordings of screams. More exotic types of violation, whether mental or physical. If she thinks it will make you behave irrationally, she will do it. When subjected to these, *real or not,* you will stand up to them. You will stand up to her.\n\nBecause if you have another outburst, you will lose the propaganda war. And that is the only method for you to sway the Judges before the Judgment begins. It is your most powerful tool. And if all that fails, she may even attempt bringing him before you and torturing him. Given the rules of decorum in the last Judgment, she would be able to get away with that. But you would not be able to get away with attacking her in return. And yes, it is unfair.\n\nYou are in Sprilnav space, surrounded by Sprilnav bodies, in a Sprilnav court with Sprilnav Judges. They will certainly be more biased toward Yasihaut. And this sort of trial, about whether you and the Alliance are a danger to the Sprilnav, is more emotion-based than evidence-based. There is likely a single way you can push on this meaningfully, Penny. And that is to keep freeing slaves, and be seen doing it. Show the slaver scum the mercy they do not deserve, so we get the mercy that we deserve in return.\n\nShow your kindness, even when you are hurting, even when the recipience deserve death and worse. Because every person you kill will be enough arsenal to outweigh any million people you save, especially if they are slaves. It is why you should avoid public disagreements with Filnatra and Arneladia over Ezeonwha and their child. In fact, heal their child before or during the Judgment if you can, and secure their public thanks.\n\nProgenitors have massive pull in Sprilnav territory. Be seen with Lecalicus, healing him if you can. And while it is likely impossible, if you can be seen healing Twilight, you will have a near-certain propaganda victory. We have no idea how the Judges might be. Perhaps they would be swayed. Perhaps not. But there are ways to exploit what has happened to you for your personal benefit. Call attention to it, only to cast aside your hatred publically. Even if you do not want to be better, appear morally superior, and Yasihaut loses the barbarian primitive argument she pushes.\n\nIt will require the swallowing of dignity, insults, and grave injustice. It will require bowing and bending to those you can break easily. It will be tough. And it will be a struggle, every second of every single day. You are not a soldier. Nor are you a weapon. Right now, you are a human, fighting for her home and her people. There are some ways to do this right, and only one way to do this wrong. Given that you are smart, powerful, and fully capable as a human and one of the finest people I have ever known, it is not a question of whether you can do this, but whether you will. And when you implement enough of this plan, you will, quite literally, kill Yasihaut with kindness.\"\n\nPenny smiled. \"Thank you, Izkrala.\"\n\nIzkrala. Not 'Empress.' She knew that making a point over such a trivial thing, especially in a private call with only Phoebe and possibly her guards listening, was not helpful. But the impulse, counterproductive as it was, still remained.\n\n\"Do you have a pen and paper?\"\n\nThey appeared in Penny's hands. A remarkable power, that. To just create whatever she needed. Consequently, it had meant Penny was able to get by in difficult locations far more easily. The military applications were obvious. Air in the void, a ship, or even a hunk of antimatter. Penny was the most powerful human ever to exist, and certainly the most influential alien the Sprilnav had seen in a long time.\n\nIzkrala had found many similarities between the known personality traits of Elder Kashaunta and herself. The main difference was that Izkrala was less willing to betray for long-term gain. And she also was far more secure in her rule. She'd pounded out the underlying will of the Alliance to replace her with a democratic government already.\n\nThe easiest way to do that was to be less outwardly authoritarian and to only hold onto power when it was necessary. To let the bureaucracy weigh itself down on issues that were unimportant, but able to be picked up like a rolling egg if the circumstances demanded it. Izkrala had the added benefit of being able to learn from online classes about motherhood as a 'person of power,' which was different than if she was just another Acuarfar in the traditional family of two females and a male. Izkrala watched Penny's gaze roam over the fur on her snout for a moment and then spoke again.\n\n\"Good. I want you to write down everything I said. I will watch, and clarify when needed.\"\n\n\"Is that necessary?\"\n\n\"Is it, Penny? Muscle memory helps with memorization. You are grieving, which will make it harder to remain objective. But you can at least do this. If a thousand people spout their drivel at you, I want you to at least remember mine above theirs. Think of it as a favor to Izkrala, not the Empress.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is not a good idea to write out our plans, then?\"\n\n*Our.* Izkrala grinned again. She'd done it.\n\n\"Well, burn it afterwards. Or just... what do you say? Displace?\"\n\n\"Yes. I should use the power of Cardinality to litter.\"\n\n\"Justicar has a star.\"\n\n\"So to litter... on the star, then.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't be a problem. I believe that stars are, generally, at least the size of five airplanes.\"\n\n\"Maybe even six airplanes,\" Penny mused. \"I'd heard you'd gotten into American culture a bit, but that is quite surprising.\"\n\nAmerica. The country certainly had some interesting quirks as relics of its golden age. Now, the wealth was more spread out and certainly up in the stars. But many humans and a large portion of Earth were still inside the various alliances it had. Of course, those groups' meanings were not very definitive.\n\nAfter all, the Pan-Andes Union, European Federation, People's Republic of China, and United States of America all were in a single binding alliance after the disastrous Third World War. Izkrala often studied older human history to learn how to deal with them better. Sometimes, it did mean manipulation, too. She was an Empress, after all. It came with the job.\n\nShe had, in fact, known about Britain.\n\n\"Perhaps. Unfortunately, adopting too much of any culture in a forward fashion would also generate a scandal.\"\n\n\"So you wouldn't wear a bikini with the stars and stripes on it, then?\"\n\n\"I'm a 'bug.' We don't do bikinis. Because, well, no boobs.\"\n\nIzkrala gestured at her thorax, which had a distinct lack of the mounds female Earth mammals carried. It was another aspect that had somewhat influenced human culture that she'd never be able to find common ground on. For humans, the equivalent would be the smaller size, lack of bio-gel or acid, and not having snouts or compound eyes.\n\nSpeaking of her eyes, Izkrala's cybernetics were getting around nicely. Bereft of her natural organs in several places, the Breyyanik designers were continually putting out better and better designs for her. She didn't always take the latest series, and she was wary about technical concerns. Though she had her own engineers and technicians assure her she couldn't be turned into some sort of unwilling drone with her cybernetics somehow.\n\n\"The Vinarii seem to make it work.\"\n\n\"They're oriented differently. Sort of like how I'm going to orient this conversation back to you taking notes of my advice.\"\n\nPenny looked to the side.\n\n\"Cardi, did you get it?\"\n\nIzkrala sighed. Children, the lot of them. Penny would likely get back to a misery session after this. But it would be shorter now. And when she shook it off, she'd start getting things *done*.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nFleet Commander Annabelle Weber directed her ships to new positions. The mock battle underway was still difficult, and she'd already 'lost' nearly half the fleet to the Cawlarians. Of course, she'd taken heavy bites out of their forces as well.\n\nThe Battle Planner, still unnamed as according to his religion, was a decent opponent. Annabelle had drilled against larger formations using Phoebe many times before. She'd always expected to be outnumbered on the battlefield, and to fight as if she was such.\n\nThey'd each been assigned various positions in the area to hold. None of them had any value, just being patches in space, but it helped to force them both to direct their fleets in new ways. The Battle Planner and Annabelle had both split their forces to cover defense and attack. Phoebe moderated the battle from both sides, with her unmatched ability to calculate damage from a shot in accordance with angle, speed, distance, and so on.\n\nNo lasers actually fired, and no bullets did either. Fighters still danced around and between ships, their weapons unloaded just in case any trigger fingers got too itchy.\n\nIt would have been stressful and complicated for her twenty years ago. But now? The formations danced easily in her head. As a node of the hivemind and just a woman with a lot of practice, she was a lot better when it came to things like this. She kept an eye on the rest of the formations. Things weren't going great. But considering the force she was up against, it wasn't terrible.\n\n\"Battlegroup 9S, decrease your thrust by 35% and turn 13 by 2.3 degrees to your current heading.\"\n\nIn space, the most efficient way to describe bearings was with angles. One for vertical direction, and another for horizontal. There was a third one for rotation, but she rarely had to tell the ships to actually rotate at a certain rate. The Commanders were well-trained, veterans of both real wars and drills.\n\nHer VIs had once helped her to learn them, but now she was well-integrated with the battle network. She could do the calculations easily and quickly visualize the battle space. Screens showing the headings of her forces alongside the positions of enemies, presumed present and presumed future, were also spread out around her. In this case, the 'enemy' markers weren't being used.\n\nThe various red symbols were replaced by orange ones, representing training. The designations ensured that their weapons wouldn't fire without direct override. And every soldier of the Alliance was educated on what the ramifications of that would be. Both sides had given extensive training to each other to ensure that nothing went wrong. The Battle Planner and Annabelle would both shut things down if it somehow got to actual shooting.\n\nAnnabelle pushed the microphone button on her spacesuit once again. The signal strength fed through the outward communication arrays on the dreadnaught, a main weakness of any armored ship in a complex battle. Several of them were already either out of alignment or 'disabled' after some sorties in previous offensives. The Communications Officers ended up having to branch the signals to produce a secondary interference-based message.\n\n\"Battlegroup 17D, regroup with 17 A, B, and C! Corkscrew formation, 52 by 135 degrees!\"\n\nThat was one of the groups she'd sent to probe the communications array group that the Cawlarians were using to strengthen their ability to coordinate. Battlegroup 16B was still in stealth, gradually waiting to spring the trap that the 17A through D groups were slowly moving toward.\n\nAnnabelle kept her eyes on the other battles. For the most part, after she'd given the Commanders their objectives and plans, they had got to work. Some of them had waited, pretending to have 'technical difficulties' before starting to move slowly.\n\nThat was as planned, too. She trusted the Commanders to do well. This was practice, but practice could only make perfect if it was perfect practice. Annabelle's spacesuit briefly tapped against the table as the ship jerked.\n\nA dreadnaught battle group, the heart of the Battle Planner's fleet, was on approach. She gave orders to make an oblique angle while keeping their guns trained on the dreadnaught to keep racking up 'hits' over time. But the ship was able to punch through the line. It shrugged off virtual hits from her dreadnaught and the battlecruiser surrounding it.\n\nThe mock invasions of the ships (also calculated through training soldiers and anti-ship crews in virtual space) only deposited sixteen sabotage companies on the Cawlarian dreadnaught, which deployed several fighter squadrons to strafe its armor.\n\nWhile they did so, Annabelle focused more firepower on the dreadnaught, hoping to whittle down its shields to turn its momentum against it. Electrical and magnetic attacks briefly took down the main shield. A few arrays on the enemy were damaged, and a thruster 'detonated' from a planted bomb right before the fighters wiped away the last company. The shields were already back up, now on the secondary section.\n\nThen the ship adjusted its angle further, linking with more battlecruisers and a few expertly placed carriers exited stealth to launch masses of nuclear missiles. The damage was quickly calculated, and Phoebe determined that the missiles would have destroyed the entire upper flank of the fleet, as well as the shields in place to stop them. Annabelle's master plan came apart, as her fleet was forced to turn its guns away from the main ship to defend itself, just as they would have done in a real battle.\n\nHer communications were entirely jammed now by the close proximity to the enemy dreadnaught. The Cawlarian formation started to fall apart, as the Alliance's own jamming turned it all into a mess. Ships almost collided as the lines approached. But the end came when the Battle Planner suddenly cut half the thrust on the dreadnaught, making it turn in just the right direction, before its backward guns aligned perfectly on Annabelle. The thrusters all fired now, preventing a collision. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Phoebe already was nudging ships back with careful thrusts.\n\nIt would make the results less perfect, but that was fine. Annabelle didn't give up, though. She wracked her brain for solutions, listened to the silence where the Captains and Commanders would have been if not for the jamming, and eventually the time ran out.\n\nThe Cawlarian dreadnaught slowed to a stop, its main guns pointed toward the reactor of her own ship.\n\nHypothetically, her shields could survive what they threw at them long enough to get out of danger. But that would end in being chased down and destroyed in a real battle. Re-enacting that portion was unnecessary at the point of the war game.\n\n\"Exercise is over,\" Phoebe declared. \"Cawlarian victory.\"\n\nAnnabelle nodded, still feeling a pang of disappointment, but glad she'd been able to do as well as she had. The jamming started dropping off on all channels. The special communication channels, reserved for emergencies, Phoebe, and anything else important enough to interrupt the battle, were still open. Through them, the Battle Planner extended a virtual reality invite, which Annabelle quickly accepted. She still had her spacesuit on, so things were clunky. But the technology of the Alliance was more than capable of contending with a bit of fat-fingering.\n\n\"Good job,\" Annabelle said, the sting of the loss already evaporating. The Battle Planner was more than worthy of her respect, and being defeated in her circumstances wasn't exactly impossible.  \n\"Thank you. You did well also, Fleet Commander. Incredibly so. What was that tactic with the asteroids?\"\n\n\"We figured that you would not blast apart the asteroids since they contained precious metals. So when your ships got close, we were able to spring that ambush. By the way, how did you manage to get that battlegroup close to the star?\"\n\n\"We used a gravitational slingshot, combined with a hard burn. The shields were able to take it. I could put you in contact with that Commander if you want.\"\n\nThe Alliance, due to having so many constituent nations within it, would always have Commanders and Captains both commanding ships. It was a small point of bloat to the military that had been accepted for easier cultural integration.\n\n\"I would appreciate that. I think he would have some good pointers to share with my people over how to properly execute that maneuver. And that twisting thing with the other ships?\"\n\n\"Corkscrew formation. It's quite good against laser fire, by its nature. It makes us a little slower, but buys time for the shield generators.\"\n\n\"I see. Phoebe, what are the metrics?\"\n\n\"Annabelle managed to inflict proportionally massive casualties for the size of her force, taking out three ships for every one of hers. For battlegroups consisting of carriers and above, it was closer to seven ships for every one of hers, minus the dreadnaught of course.\"\n\n\"I see. I believe my last ration in a similar situation was about two for every one. It is likely a product your your superior tactical mind.\"\n\n\"You compliment me, Battle Planner. Yet your rank and name lend credence to your own wit. You managed to counter most of my moves, and even come up with some I had to pull back from fully, because they were so masterful. Is it in all Cawlarians' natures to have such knowledge of three-dimensional battle?\"\n\n\"We have studies showing that our minds are better than most for it, yes. It is likely because of our ancient evolutionary roots as prey. We had to be aware of our surroundings to survive in the trees.\"\n\nAnnabelle nodded. \"I heard something like that before, but I'm glad to hear it confirmed.\"\n\n\"If we were to project the losses Annabelle incurred to the objectives she was able to capture, she was able to do more damage overall. She took out two of the planet crackers, preventing one from firing,\" Phoebe said.\n\n\"Our firing times are shorter than that,\" the Battle Planner smiled. \"But yes. Well done. And that planetary evacuation was extremely well organized. You really didn't have Phoebe's help for that?\"\n\n\"No. Phoebe gave us advanced VIs, which are able to handle the logistical might required for that. Out of 50 million civilians, we are able to get 30 million out before the cracker's firing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Phoebe said. \"31.4 million.\"\n\n\"What a galaxy, where we discuss such things so casually,\" the Battle Planner sighed.\n\n\"Yes. And we're on our way to war soon, after two more exercises.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate. And Siran has refused our latest request for surrender, and is regrouping more heavily along the border. He will make a push into the Union within three months. Our spies suggest it will be probably two, depending on the outcome of the current battle with the Federation. Our fleet will be going to relieve the battles between the Federation and the High Kingdom. After that, we will unify to attack additional critical operations points in the Kingdom, and then the final push toward Siran himself once the border patrol fleet also advances.\"\n\n\"Do you still have enough ships to hold the line, given all current information?\"\n\n\"In a straight battle, certainly. And we have enough committed to this theater to do that. But Siran will likely still strike against as many planets as he can with hit and run attacks. The shields can only do so much.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to have a full debreifing session? Or perhaps another Co-Defensive Integration meeting?\" Annabelle asked.\n\n\"Give me fifty minutes, Fleet Commander. I have some things I need to sort out.\"\n\n\"Are they negative?\"\n\n\"Some of my captains took a few too many risks. In a real war, those risks would have gotten them killed for nothing, and actually worsened our position.\"\n\nA serious thing to rectify.\n\n\"Alright then.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your understanding. Do you wish for a full hour?\"\n\n\"To give me more time to chew out my men?\"\n\n\"To give you the time you need to ensure your fighting forces are in top shape,\" Annabelle corrected. The Battle Planner indicated his pleasure with her decision. Annabelle would use the time herself to go over a few things she noticed. It wouldn't take long, given the training that the Captains had. Being overbearing on absolutely tiny things that couldn't reasonably be improved made no sense.\n\nShe hoped that the Battle Planner's forces would be better in the next mission. Giving her fewer gaps to exploit would only help her learn how to fight more fortified enemies even better. Fighting in her actual ship with a real enemy was better than VI training.\n\n\"We can move to the next training location after the meeting.\"\n\nPhoebe's eyes grew distant. \"There are about 40 ships on approach, all with odd signatures. They seem to have just exited stealth mode. Are these yours, Battle Planner?\"\n\n\"Those ships arrived faster than expected,\" the Battle Planner replied. \"I just got contacted by them.\"\n\n\"Were they on the list?\"\n\n\"All of them are, but they appear to have one more ship than normal.\"\n\nAnnabelle frowned. \"Which type of group is it in?\"\n\n\"Battlecruiser,\" the Battle Planner said. \"I can tell you're put off by their arrival.\"\n\n\"I would suggest heightened caution,\" Annabelle said. \"Exactly how many ships are there, and how many did you expect?\"\n\n\"40, and there are 41... wait. The lightspeed limit's passed, and I got a transmission. Tell your people to avert their guns from that ship. Do not fire on it, *at all costs*.\"\n\n\"Your sensors are better than mine,\" Annabelle said. \"What is that ship?\"\n\nThe sensor readings her helmet showed her were all off.\n\n\"It's not a Sprilnav ship. It's a diplomatic vessel from the Misan Interstellar Gathering.\"",

        "selftext": "im new to this school in south Alaska. i moved here from new york two months ago and am still having such a hard time ajusting. No one even recognizes that i exist anymore. And i know its all my fault, you see, i was very popluar on my first day here, as i am very pretty (not to brag) i got long blond hair and bright green eyes with the face of julia roberts in the 90s.I was sitting in math class on the first day and a boy tugged on my hair from behind me, playfully,I turned around to see his handsome face, deep hazel eyes and chocolate hair. One would say we look perfect together, oh, and he had the most perfect voice too. he told me his name was jake and i told him mine was casandra, casandra davies. he then invited me to come to this big party that was happening friday night by the lake.\n\n\"i don't know..\" I said nerviously \n\n\"Comeon' i'll be so happy to see you..\"\n\nI later agreed when I noticed he had a crush on me. he was always asking me irrelavant questions, looking at me brushing my hair and i over heard him talking about me. And it was exicting. *maybe he will be my first kiss*, i thought. \n\nWhen i arrived at the lake shore party it was not at all how i expected it to be. there were barley any people, just bunch of football dudes in their varsity jackets. they all looked my way and asked if i was looking for jake.\n\n\"yeah, how'd you know?\" I ask\n\nOne of them chuckled and said \"Well hes waiting for you, up there.....\n\nhe pointed up at the water tower, about 30 feet high.\n\n...he wants to kiss you up there, it will be very romantic.\"\n\nI was filled with excitment and started climbing my way up. Around hafway thought i questioned if this was safe, but i perserviered. I made it to the top and jake was there looking beautiful and tall. I was ready to kiss him. I leaned in for a kiss with my eyes closed, ready to kiss him, but next thing you know I was falling. Somehow I sliped off that tower, broke both of my ribs and my left leg. I was not only in horrible pain, but embarresed. When I came back from the hospital no one talked to me. they acted as if i wasnt even there. the teacher didnt even call my name for attentence. And now even my own father locks himself away in his room, never speaking with me. all i can hear is him crying and wailing at night. I knock as his door and call his name but he never answers. I know he is ashamed of me. how could i be so stupid to climb that thing? \n\nNow a new drama is on the loose at school, there is no way im getting peoples attention back on me. espically since its about some girl who died. rumor has it that jake killed her. No wonder he isnt talking to me, he must be so stressed right now. But i just couldn't help myself, i wanted to know what he was up to. So i followed him one night, he was in a gas station buying some ciggerettes with a fake ID. Oh boy, this must be so hard on him. When he got out of the gas station, cop cars pulled up, jake was shaking of fear. The two cops cuffed him, \n\n\"you are under arrest for the murder of cansandra davies.\" one said\n\n\"but i didnt kill her! She fell off i swear!\" \n\n\"yeah and what about Tonia morris or Blaire mallows? they all fell off the same tower the same year?\"\n\nI was the dead girl. \n\nI felt hands on both of my shoudlers, I turn to see two girls \"Dont worry, we didn't know we were dead at first too.\" \n\n\"This isn't fair\" I screamed with tears running down my eyes.\n\n\"we know, but we will make it fair......",

        "selftext": "The more time passes by, the more I can see how grown up I have become, yet at the same time I can see how I cling to childish things because I never got over my troubled past. Only when I am sad do I realize that at other times I was happy. What makes it sting is that while I realize this now, at that particular moment I did not think I was happy, I was just as confused and lonely, I struggled with thoughts of inadequacy and I ignored huge chunks of my life that I should have worked on at that moment\u2026same as I am doing now. So even though I grew, in some respects I have not broken the cycle of mistakes, I have not outgrown my inability to live in the moment and enjoy life for what it is.   \nAmbition was never my thing, at least not in the areas that \u201cmattered\u201d like having a career or losing weight. I wonder if I will ever get that spark of \u201cwanting to accomplish something\u201d long enough in a stretch to make it happen? I quit smoking, that must count for something, right? But I could not have done it if I would not have had the support of my friends that were non-smokers at the time. I just want that - once and for all - to get the ambition to get to a normal weight and stay there, without letting myself go and embracing my vice, you know? I just find such comfort in eating good food, just letting go and enjoying that primal need... the one single thing that brings me true joy and excitement, yet digs my grave deeper.  \nI need to understand the root of my food addiction, of my bad habits. What is the catalyst? What fear or unmet desire is triggering this unhealthy need? If only I could figure these things out, understand how to undo them, then perhaps my life would get better. I have reached that point already, the point of no return. It's one of those moments in my life, that, if I cannot bring it under my control, I fear it will take over and years of my life will just tick off in a blur of cloudy days. I see this moment in my daydreams sometimes, as a ghost of a past life that had not yet come to pass. It\u2019s strange\u2026this feeling, it\u2019s a sort of emptiness, a sort of hunger, a sort of loneliness mixed with anger, all while a muffled slumber numbs every emotion in my body.   \nYou remember those moments in your childhood when things were alive, trees, people, nature, and the sky itself had a soul and all was good\u2026at least to some extent? I keep hoping that I will live to experience life the same way again, that I will feel again the same excitement and the same happiness before going to bed and waking new and refreshed, but the stronger my desire to live that again, the more I know in reality life will never be the same and while that\u2019s a natural thing that comes with growing, it\u2019s still sad and it leaves me inconsolable.  \nWhat if I never find what I am looking for, what if I will just be another fat person that dies prematurely for the statistics? I can see myself becoming the one that never managed to find that inner strength. I honestly cringe when I see videos of \u201cweight loss journeys\u201d, I judge them, yet I am still happy for their success. Feelings are so complicated sometimes, on one hand I envy people that have achieved great things, then I find them conceited and shallow for making such a spectacle out of it. On the other hand, I am happy for them and wish I was able to find that motivation. \n\nMeanwhile, I have a deep fear of losing the actual weight. I am happy without the attention of men for example. I find it so weird, just seeing it from the outside happen to my friends. I could not stand a man giving me attention over my body like that, I would always find it suspicious, fake and deceitful, like he would try to make fun of me or be sarcastic, regardless of his true intentions, I would not be able to help it. All my life I have hidden behind the fat exterior and I evaded uncomfortable situations. Even though this brought me loneliness, I still think it\u2019s better than meeting someone that would make me miserable. I just think that if the fat would be gone, I would feel incredibly vulnerable to situations that I never had to deal with before. Also, what if I still don\u2019t get the attention I imagine I would have gotten had I been normal my entire life? What if actually nothing changes, what if I will still feel lonely and insecure and I would still hide and reject people? Will losing the weight guarantee me an easier life? A more fulfilled life? Truth is, I will never know the answers to these questions unless it happens. Sure, I can try and relate to others, but I will never know for sure unless it happens.I am just scared and angry at how my life turned out, while I know it\u2019s not fair for me to overthink it, or try to find excuses. Anyway, I must sleep, just wanted to put this out into the universe and get it off my mind.  \n",

        "selftext": "This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so please be nice as I don\u2019t know how all of this works yet! \n\nOkay so here it goes.. I will try to make a very long and complicated story short. \n\nMy paternal grandfather groomed me my entire childhood (heavily favored me, showered me with gifts, special attention, money, trips, etc.) as well as exposing me to CP, and touching me inappropriately. I didn\u2019t have a solid father figure as I was adopted by my grandma (whom was the grandfather\u2019s EX wife) at age 3 and my parents struggled for years with substance abuse so, to me this relationship was just my normal. I spent nearly every weekend from age 6 to age 13 at my grandfather\u2019s house. There was a long history of predatory behavior from my grandfather along with substance use that led his only daughter (my aunt) to significantly limit his contact with her four children. So basically, my four cousins had very minimal relationship with him. When I was 11 my grandfather began a predatory and sexual relationship with one of my friends. She was also in my age range. This went on for nearly a year before I finally told my grandmother what was going on with my friend. I never told about what was going on with me though. This led to a family meeting with my biological father, my grandmother, the grandfather, and the aunt. They basically told him \u201cHey! Knock it off or else\u201d but never reported any of it to the authorities and my weekend visits continued soon after. The relationship that I had with the grandfather obviously was extremely impactful for me and as I got older the financial control and manipulation continued. It\u2019s all I ever knew. When I was 18 our relationship was still active (he played a father role in my life, regardless of the dark secrets that festered beneath). At 18 he signed a car note for me, my name was not on it in any way but I had to make the payment each month. He also signed on two credit cards for various things, also without my name on them. The car quickly became a pawn much like all of the financial support he provided and he used it to insist I put a tracker on my phone. He would say if I didn\u2019t keep the tracker on the phone he would take the car. He could see my phone battery life through the tracker and if I didn\u2019t pick up a call or return a text he would angrily text me that my battery percentage was lowering therefore he knew I was on my phone. He would warn me if I didn\u2019t text him back he would take my car. So on and so forth. At this point in my life all of the secrets I had kept were boiling under the surface and the continuation of the dysfunction and financial manipulation was starting to really affect me. One day i had had enough. I decided that not only was my childhood NOT okay but the cycle following me into adulthood was also NOT okay. I took the car with the two credit cards on the dash and left it all in his driveway and never spoke to him again after that. A handful of years later I had a stillbirth and two days later my biological dad was murdered. (Yes, I know very crazy and sad) This led me to the all time low mentally and I decided to check myself into a 6 weeks outpatient therapy program. I am 21 at this point. During this 6 week therapy I let it ALL out. All of the secrets, the lies, the abuse. It felt so good to finally say it out loud. A few days later my therapist called me into his office and there stood two detectives. He then informed me that he was a mandated reporter and had no choice but to report the things I had shared. I was angry at first but I knew that I was not the only victim and felt that maybe I could do some good in this and that it could be healing for me. I informed my family about everything so they were not blindsided by the eventual FBI raid on his home and possibly arrest. Everyone was very supportive and remorseful for their negligence and all was somewhat okay. He never ended up being arrested because of some frustrating CP loopholes (think deepfake)  Until it wasn\u2019t. In 2023 the grandfather was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had always put a huge emphasis on his big amazing inheritance and how no one should cross him or he would write them out of the will. I was fine with this consequence because no inheritance would ever be worth as much as the freedom I had when I spoke up. But, the tone of the Aunt (his daughter) and her four children quickly shifted. Suddenly my story was being questioned. Suddenly they all wanted to spend time with him and heal things with him. It sucked. He died 3 weeks after his cancer diagnosis. The day of his funeral the will was to be read in the presence of all of the beneficiaries. The aunt, her four children, me, and my two sisters. The aunt was the controller of the will. The will was pretty standard until the reader got to a specific section that called me out by name that stated I was indebted to him in the amount of 15k which would be taken out of whatever money I would have inherited after the inheritance was split between all of the beneficiaries. The kicker though was that the 15k that was going to be taken out of my inheritance had to be split amongst all of the other trustees. The aunt, her four kids, and my sisters. My sister\u2019s immediately said absolutely not. That they would be giving that specific portion right back to me and that they would not participate in this man\u2019s revenge plot. Everyone else in my entire family also is appalled by this and is on my side. The aunt and her four children however stood firmly that a debt is a debt and none of the nuances mattered. They even admitted that it was clearly revenge but that I received more gifts and money from him than anyone else as a child and I should be grateful for that. In case it isn\u2019t clear the \u201cdebt\u201d was for the car and credit cards I screwed him on signifying me putting my foot down on our messed up relationship. Or so they say. I know he spent around $15k on legal defense after I reported him\u2026 so it seems like he\u2019s making me pay for his lawyers he had to get for his own sick actions if you ask me. He lost all of his power and control over me in that moment and he made sure to hurt me back in the end. He knew that seeing them accept that money would destroy me, and it did. Everyone ended up with $20k each, I ended up with $5k and during the dispersement meeting I gracefully ended my relationship with aunt and her four kids. I lived with them at one point during childhood and was very close with them. I even proposed we donate the 15k debt to a non profit with a focus on child exploitation and they wouldn\u2019t do it. Because \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be punished because I had a debt\u201d. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something and maybe there will be questions that I will gladly answer in the comments but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for now. So, am I the asshole for dividing my whole family and going no contact with the aunt and her kids? \n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t about the money. It\u2019s about the principle of my loved ones directly benefiting from the revenge my abuser bestowed on me with a smile on their face. People that didn\u2019t even have a relationship with him. It feels like by taking that money they are saying \u201cwe pick him. Not you\u201d \n\nLast thing I promise. One of aunts kids has a wife and the wife and I became best friends for 6 YEARS and she ended our relationship right after grandfather died out of the blue, because she knew about the will and wanted to keep the money guilt free. So boo to her. \n\n",

Albeit, this case seems extremely unique considering the abuse you suffered, and your grandfather leaving you debt in his will, which I didn't even know was possible.\n\nIf your Aunt and cousins are coming after you for money, start calling lawyers. I truly can't believe this situation is legal, although I'm not a lawyer. I wish I had more advice to give. If it does come down to a legal fight, post the specifics in every lawyer thread you can find on Reddit. Also, call every Billboard lawyer in your area and ask if they have a free consultation.",

So, am I the asshole for dividing my whole family and going no contact with the aunt and her kids?\n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t about the money. It\u2019s about the principle of my loved ones directly benefiting from the revenge my abuser bestowed on me with a smile on their face. People that didn\u2019t even have a relationship with him. It feels like by taking that money they are saying \u201cwe pick him. Not you\u201d\n\nLast thing I promise. One of aunts kids has a wife and the wife and I became best friends for 6 YEARS and she ended our relationship right after grandfather died out of the blue, because she knew about the will and wanted to keep the money guilt free. So boo to her.",

They use money, guilt, fear etc to rer\nTain control and it's very likely your aunt suffered abuse as well.  That doesn't mean you owe her any kind of grace, as an adult she decided not support you, the victim.  So she and her kids can fuck all the way off.  \nMy wife suffered a lot of similar abuse and similar actions from family members.  It's truly bizarre, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't live it, if I wasn't beside her the entire time.\nI can share with you how it went for her, us.  We have raised 3 daughters together, have taught them to be strong women and never hold their tongues when they don't feel right.  We have been married for 14 years, she and we are happy, and loved.  She still has a lot of issues, especially with anxiety but she set the standard for the type of family she would create and raise and we have wonderful children become wonderful adults.  She's successful in her career and the best mom and wife.\nI only tell you this to relay that in your words I see strength and if you stay strong, you will create the life you deserve.\nI'm proud of you and hope to hear about you doing great things in the future.",

        "selftext": "Got my Vision Pro device on February 2nd, just in a few days had the idea of building a place where people can share spatial videos and panoramas, because the experience watching them on Vision Pro is really impressive and unique. Stopped for a few weeks and in the last week of February really pushed and built v1. In 3 weeks got 2000 users, more than 600 posts. \n\nFew things about the area/project:\n\n1. The App Store platform is terrible right now for Vision Pro, it is close to impossible to actually discover new apps for users. Everything is hidden behind the search, so users have to know about your app to find it. The only option is being self promoting on vision pro subreddits. \n\n2. There is a lot of competition. I think at this point there are 5 or even more apps for sharing spatial videos, a few for sharing panoramas. I am just trying ahead by bringing more features and making good product. \n\n3. I have used CloudKit Public database as backend, that serves soo well. The asset storage grows with number of users. You start with 10GB, but with hitting 2000 users it is already 400GB, and the hosted content just a little over 20GB. \n\n4. It is so fun to actually work in a new field. On a device that you just got (and to be honest not much you can do on it), with platform which is so exciting and fresh. Obviously VisionPro is not new in that field, and I have Quest3 (and had Quest, Quest2 and Rift), but that was a different platform that I was not excited about. \n\n5. The best thing is user content. It gives me so much excitement. So many beautiful panoramas, so many interesting spatial videos. \n\n6. Surprisingly, I don\u2019t have to moderate it much. Version 1 required to put all content through my approval, but I rejected only one video - as not sure about how I feel about DeepFake videos with famous people. At this point no moderation is there. People can report content, I can ban users, but so far did not have to. \n\n7. I had 0 experience building social platforms. Before system engineer, tools for developers and before that Enterprise software. \n\nHappy to answer any questions about the platform. If you have VisionPro - feel free to try it out, if you have some spatial videos, panoramas or 360 panoramas - feel free to share it from iOS (iPhone) https://immersishare.app/ and you can watch the uploaded content on iPhone, just obviously not that interesting without the immersive experience.

        "selftext": "This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so please be nice as I don\u2019t know how all of this works yet! \n\nOkay so here it goes.. I will try to make a very long and complicated story short. \n\nMy paternal grandfather groomed me my entire childhood (heavily favored me, showered me with gifts, special attention, money, trips, etc.) as well as exposing me to CP, and touching me inappropriately. I didn\u2019t have a solid father figure as I was adopted by my grandma (whom was the grandfather\u2019s EX wife) at age 3 and my parents struggled for years with substance abuse so, to me this relationship was just my normal. I spent nearly every weekend from age 6 to age 13 at my grandfather\u2019s house. There was a long history of predatory behavior from my grandfather along with substance use that led his only daughter (my aunt) to significantly limit his contact with her four children. So basically, my four cousins had very minimal relationship with him. When I was 11 my grandfather began a predatory and sexual relationship with one of my friends. She was also in my age range. This went on for nearly a year before I finally told my grandmother what was going on with my friend. I never told about what was going on with me though. This led to a family meeting with my biological father, my grandmother, the grandfather, and the aunt. They basically told him \u201cHey! Knock it off or else\u201d but never reported any of it to the authorities and my weekend visits continued soon after. The relationship that I had with the grandfather obviously was extremely impactful for me and as I got older the financial control and manipulation continued. It\u2019s all I ever knew. When I was 18 our relationship was still active (he played a father role in my life, regardless of the dark secrets that festered beneath). At 18 he signed a car note for me, my name was not on it in any way but I had to make the payment each month. He also signed on two credit cards for various things, also without my name on them. The car quickly became a pawn much like all of the financial support he provided and he used it to insist I put a tracker on my phone. He would say if I didn\u2019t keep the tracker on the phone he would take the car. He could see my phone battery life through the tracker and if I didn\u2019t pick up a call or return a text he would angrily text me that my battery percentage was lowering therefore he knew I was on my phone. He would warn me if I didn\u2019t text him back he would take my car. So on and so forth. At this point in my life all of the secrets I had kept were boiling under the surface and the continuation of the dysfunction and financial manipulation was starting to really affect me. One day i had had enough. I decided that not only was my childhood NOT okay but the cycle following me into adulthood was also NOT okay. I took the car with the two credit cards on the dash and left it all in his driveway and never spoke to him again after that. A handful of years later I had a stillbirth and two days later my biological dad was murdered. (Yes, I know very crazy and sad) This led me to the all time low mentally and I decided to check myself into a 6 weeks outpatient therapy program. I am 21 at this point. During this 6 week therapy I let it ALL out. All of the secrets, the lies, the abuse. It felt so good to finally say it out loud. A few days later my therapist called me into his office and there stood two detectives. He then informed me that he was a mandated reporter and had no choice but to report the things I had shared. I was angry at first but I knew that I was not the only victim and felt that maybe I could do some good in this and that it could be healing for me. I informed my family about everything so they were not blindsided by the eventual FBI raid on his home and possibly arrest. Everyone was very supportive and remorseful for their negligence and all was somewhat okay. He never ended up being arrested because of some frustrating CP loopholes (think deepfake)  Until it wasn\u2019t. In 2023 the grandfather was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had always put a huge emphasis on his big amazing inheritance and how no one should cross him or he would write them out of the will. I was fine with this consequence because no inheritance would ever be worth as much as the freedom I had when I spoke up.

        "selftext": "Before I say any of this, I do want to say I have no formal diagnosis of anything. I have not been to any medical professionals about my mental health, despite wanting to. I plan on talking to my parents about this and hopefully seeking help in early May. I\u2019ve posted this on multiple subs and haven\u2019t been able to find the support I need, so I\u2019m hoping this works. \n\nI developed what I\u2019m 99.9% sure is DPDR after an experiencing a major hurricane when I was 13, nearly 7 years ago. It does not come in waves or episodes, it is constant and progressed significantly over the years. Within the last 2-ish has become increasingly hard to manage, but I was still able to properly live with it despite the issues. For the last few years (3-4 years after the initial onset), I would smoke weed occasionally. I would never do it very often, a few times per month if that, sometimes with large breaks in between. It would affect the depersonalization sometimes, but never enough to where I felt the need to stop. I typically would just go right back to my baseline level of dissociation. Last week, I had a medical joint which I had already hit multiple times in the days before. It was basically the last half of it and I decided to finish it off. I took like 9 hits (not abnormal for me) and it sent me spiraling. The entire world around me was spinning and didn\u2019t stop for hours. I felt detachment that I genuinely did not think was possible. I went to sleep hoping I\u2019d be better by morning but the detachment stayed. I feel very lethargic and dizzy constantly. It feels like the people I talk to and the world around me are completely fake, significantly more so than before. My vision is extremely blurry for any semi-long distance, and I can barely focus my eyes on anything. I\u2019m becoming more and more depressed and constantly in a state of panic. These are all symptoms I had before, but now it has escalated to a point where I cannot function how I used to, which is extremely bad because this month is extremely important and busy when it comes to school. \n\nI\u2019m a very anxious and somewhat paranoid person, so my brain is typically going overdrive on whatever is stressing me out. I think this is causing my DPDR to be as persistent as it is. This is not without a lack of trying to manage my anxiety, though. I regularly take anxiety relieving herbs like chamomile and lavender, try to practice deep breathing, manage and rationalize my thoughts whenever I can, take breaks when I need to, spend time in nature, etc. My parents are aware of my anxiety as well, though not to the real severity of it. Part of the problem is that the event that triggered my DPDR is unavoidable, I live in an extremely hurricane prone area. And my other obsessive anxious thoughts have been persistent since I was a child. \n\nI am really desperate at this point. I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019ve spent the entirety of my teenage years feeling completely outside of my body. I never mentioned it to adults around me because I had no idea how to even begin to explain it and was very afraid of what their reaction might be or how it might impact their view of me. And now, this has spiraled completely out of my control. Stress management has not worked and I need an alternative treatment. I will talk to them very soon, but this next month is extremely heavy with school and I need a temporary solution to be able to function in the meantime. If anyone could help me, I would appreciate it so much. \n\nEdit: Some distractions like playing a video game seem to help marginally, but I am still very dissociated during it and I cannot rely on that as a solution. It consumes everything I do, even when I\u2019m not consciously thinking about it. I want to be able to spend time with my family and not be overwhelmed by dissociation, which is not possible with the way I currently am. I also intend on never touching weed again, I was never dependent on it to begin with and I cannot risk this getting any worse. ",

Tickets were expensive. \n\n\u2014 \n\nI met Becca\u2019s family. They were wonderful. \n\n\u2014 \n\nAfter months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90\u2019s shows, listening to new \u201cbest of\u201d playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  \n\nIt was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. \n\nIn truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: \u201cdas ist normal.\u201d \n\nTickets weren\u2019t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently\u2014the film was supposed to be good.  \n\nI was curious from a typical filmgoer\u2019s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* \n\nBy some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were \u2026 *strange*. It's like they\u2019re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* \n\nA tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this \u201cexquisite gem\u201d of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. \n\nI took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. \n\nSoon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  \n\nThen the movie started. \n\n\u2014 \n\nThe opening scene is loud. It\u2019s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don\u2019t know my medieval times)*.* We\u2019re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  \n\nA skewer goes through my stomach.  \n\nI\u2019m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon\u2019s dead body. \n\n*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* \n\nI exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  \n\n*It\u2019s just a movie. Just pretend it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s all you're here to see.* \n\nAfter a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie\u2019s plot. And to my surprise, I do. \n\nVery quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  \n\nIn subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, \u201cI would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.\u201d The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. \n\nAs luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet\u2014on one of the meat skewers. There\u2019s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom\u2019s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina\u2019s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  \n\nThe wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. \n\nThat night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m your new husband.\u201d \n\nPolina is of course scared. Confused. \u201cYou\u2019re my new husband?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.\u201d \n\nPolina\u2019s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil\u2019s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. \n\nThrough title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty \n\n\u201cWhy are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town\u2019s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. \n\nIn the morning, Polina\u2019s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. \u201cThe pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor\u2019s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig\u2019s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina\u2019s dead husband-to-be. \n\nPolina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. \n\nOn Polina\u2019s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. \u201cHe gets along well with the children,\u201d Polina explains. \n\nAlthough the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. \n\nBut the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  \n\n\u201cHow come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?\u201d \n\nPolina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. \n\nShe leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  \n\n\u201cNow lay with me.\u201d The swine says.  \n\nTeeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that\u2019s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig\u2019s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. \n\n\u201cWrap an arm around me.\u201d \n\nPolina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. \n\n\u201cA wife must lay with her husband,\u201d The pig says. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will. Or your soul is mine.\u201d \n\nWithout much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig\u2019s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  \n\n\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d \n\nThe pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig\u2019s molars.  \n\nAt this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  \n\nIt is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  \n\nThey are about to kiss.  \n\nAre they actually going to?  \n\nThey do.  \n\nI hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. \n\n*\u201cMein Gott \u2026 \u201d* \n\n*\u201cWiderlich.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cIt must be fake \u2026 \u201d* \n\nBut it\u2019s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human\u2019s mouth like an over-excited dog. \n\nPolina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. \n\n\u201cKiss me! KISS ME!\u201d \n\nWhen I look back at the screen, Polina\u2019s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. \u201cThe Devil has my daughter!\u201d  \n\nThe pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. \n\nWe see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  \n\nFade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina\u2019s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. \n\nShe is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. \n\nWith nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. \n\nThe camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what\u2019s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds \u2026 she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. \n\nWhen we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I\u2019ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. \u201c*Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119? Czy ja \u017cyj\u0119?\u201d* \n\n\u201cAm I alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo you are not.\u201d The pig\u2019s voice returns. \u201cYou have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.\u201d   \n   \nPolina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d She yells. \n\n\u201cYour soul is forfeit. It is mine.\u201d \n\nPolina takes her hands in her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. \n\nThere\u2019s squealing. Screaming. \n\n*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  \n\n\u201cAnd because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.\u201d \n\nSomething invisible takes a bite of Polina\u2019s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. \n\nThen the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. \n\nI feel a panic attack coming on. I can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can\u2019t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. \n\nI plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It\u2019s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. \n\n*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* \n\nBut then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. \n\nThis Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire \u2026 emerges a ten foot demon.  \n\nThe thing from hell. \n\nEveryone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. \n\nThe thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.\u201d Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. \u201cNo no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.\u201d \n\nI held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. \n\nEven now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. \n\nIt was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  \n\n*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* \n\nThe sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. \n\nNow here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time \u2026 mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. \n\nMy heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can\u2019t unsee it. I can\u2019t unhear it.  \n\nIt is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. \n\nThe screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. \n\n\u2014 \n\nWhen I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. \n\nI am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? \n\nI wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. \n\nI look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  \n\nThe applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. \n\nThe director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d  Olek says. \n\n\u2014   \n   \nCatharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nOn stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. \n\nAnd then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. \n\n\u201cWho did your cinematography? It was beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere did you find your actors? Unbelievable.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you pull off those VFX? How?\u201d \n\nSomething inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* \n\n*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* \n\nI was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? \n\n*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. \n\n\u201cMurderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!\u201d \n\nPatrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. \n\nI began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. \u201cAdrian Kowalski! Pawe\u0142 Nowak! Martyna Wi\u015bniewska! \u2026\u201d I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. \n\nA security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. \n\n\u201cPlease do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.\u201d \n\nI finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. \n\n\u201cShe is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,\u201d Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. \u201cA man named \u0141ukasz D\u0119browski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.\u201d He lifted his hand, \u201cI \u2026 was one of those students\u201d \n\nSharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*\u2019s. \n\n\u201cYes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.\u201d \n\nAudience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real \u0141ukasz actually found and arrested? \n\nBefore I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. \n\nJust another attention seeker. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOnce the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating\u2014I was trudging through molasses. \n\nTo make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. \n\nI did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn\u2019t just blow off my partner. \n\n\u201cAnna! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!\u201d \n\nI gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. \n\n\u201cWe should get a couple drinks!\u201d Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. \u201cEveryone\u2019s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!\u201d \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* \n\nSo despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn\u2019t want to be recognized as \u2018*that person at the Q&A*\u2019, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. \n\n\u201cCould you feel it in the room?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou mean, the energy? The magic?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!\u201d Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. \u201cThat was insane!\u201d \n\nI nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the guy?\u201d One of Becca\u2019s new friends asked. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy!\u201d Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. \u201cAnna, you\u2019ll never believe this, but I\u2019ve got some amazing news. You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d \n\nI knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she didn\u2019t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets \u2026* \n\n\u201cIm shooting his next one. I\u2019m officially his next DP!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome!\u201d The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  \n\nThe information passed through me. It didn\u2019t register. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great Anna?\u201d Becca hovered her martini close to mine. \n\n\u201cIsn't what great?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shooting Olek\u2019s next movie. My first art house, I\u2019ve caught my big break!\u201d \n\nI stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s \u2026 what?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know! Crazy right!\u201d She bumped my glass and took a big swig. \n\nI crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can\u2019t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You can never do it. Please don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  She indicated \u2018another round\u2019 to the bartender. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at the hotel.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnna, are you alright?\u201d \n\nI shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn\u2019t follow. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hotel?\u201d She called behind my back. I didn\u2019t reply.  \n\n\u2014 \n\nI was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can\u2019t be happening. There\u2019s no way any of this is real.* \n\nI bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. \n\nI wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. \n\nI closed my eyes. *You\u2019re gonna be okay. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re gonna be okay.* \n\nThen a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* \n\nWhen I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  \n\nOlek was in my room. \n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d he said. \n\nI stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. \n\nAnd yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. \n\n\u201cBerlin huh?\u201d \n\nI tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn\u2019t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. \n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the movie?\u201d \n\nI briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? \n\n\u201cYou know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.\u201d He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. \u201cDo you want me to fix it again?\u201d  \n\nIce cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. \u201cN-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.\u201d \n\nHe walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were the first one I\u2019ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?\u201d \n\nOutside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek\u2019s reflection. \u201cDo you like mercy?\u201d \n\nI cleared my throat. Nodded. \n\n\u201cGood. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her\u201d He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. \n\n\u201cSpeaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?\u201d \n\nMy eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn\u2019t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. \n\n\u201cI couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot \u2026 she\u2019s forever gone.\u201d \n\nHis dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. \n\n*Don\u2019t move. Remain steady. Don\u2019t show fear.* \n\n\u201cIt is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.\u201d \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. \n\nI pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. \n\n\u201cYou're within reach.\u201d Is all he eventually said.  \n\nThen he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  \n\nBut Olek wasn\u2019t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a party happening. An underground club. You\u2019re welcome to join if you want.\u201d \n\nI was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* \n\nHe seemed to be able to read my face. \n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d \n\nHe turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik\u2019s presence vanished down the hall. \n\nI ran over and shut everything\u2014applied all locks.  \n\nThen I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? \u2026 Do I \u2026 Did that \u2026 actually just happen?* \n\n*Am I dreaming?* \n\nI grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  \n\nBehind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything\u2019s wiped. This can\u2019t be happening. \n\nAfter a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  \n\n*I must have just woken up. That\u2019s all.* \n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. \n\nI pretended it was all a dream. \n\nPretending is what I\u2019m good at. \n\nPretending is all I\u2019ve got. \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014   \n \n\nThe film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. \n\nI told her she could send me pictures\u2014but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  \n\nShe agreed, and very few pictures were sent. \n\nAt work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. \n\nSometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I\u2019d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. \n\nI would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. \n\nIt just was what it was. \n\nI pretended it was normal. \n\nI knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. \n\nSo halfway through Becca\u2019s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. \n\n\u2014 \n\nOn the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. \n\nThere were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. \n\nWe introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. \n\nThe older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. \n\nThe younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my heart sank. \n\nI tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThey were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It\u2019s just plastic. It can\u2019t hurt me.* \n\n*There is no way I can give up on this class.* \n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d The younger instructor asked. \n\nI nodded quickly. \u201cYeah yeah, just trying them on.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Try opening our test file.\u201d \n\nOur computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010\u2019s dance hit. \n\nAs a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   \n   \nI scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn\u2019t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. \n\nIt was squealing.  \n\nAt first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn\u2019t stop.  \n\nThe instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. \n\nThe squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*\u201c Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn\u2014\u201d* \n\nI dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. \n\n\u201cYup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I\u2019m just\u2014I can handle it.\u201d   \n   \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\nThe teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there\u2019s no way she would. It must\u2019ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. \n\nI was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  \n\nI held my face and started to sob. I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u2014   \n \n[KONIEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)",

        "selftext": "Before I say any of this, I do want to say I have no formal diagnosis of anything. I have not been to any medical professionals about my mental health, despite wanting to. I plan on talking to my parents about this and hopefully seeking help in early May. I\u2019ve posted this on multiple subs and haven\u2019t been able to find the support I need, so I\u2019m hoping this works. \n\nI developed what I\u2019m 99.9% sure is DPDR after an experiencing a major hurricane when I was 13, nearly 7 years ago. It does not come in waves or episodes, it is constant and progressed significantly over the years. Within the last 2-ish has become increasingly hard to manage, but I was still able to properly live with it despite the issues. For the last few years (3-4 years after the initial onset), I would smoke weed occasionally. I would never do it very often, a few times per month if that, sometimes with large breaks in between. It would affect the depersonalization sometimes, but never enough to where I felt the need to stop. I typically would just go right back to my baseline level of dissociation. Last week, I had a medical joint which I had already hit multiple times in the days before. It was basically the last half of it and I decided to finish it off. I took like 9 hits (not abnormal for me) and it sent me spiraling. The entire world around me was spinning and didn\u2019t stop for hours. I felt detachment that I genuinely did not think was possible. I went to sleep hoping I\u2019d be better by morning but the detachment stayed. I feel very lethargic and dizzy constantly. It feels like the people I talk to and the world around me are completely fake, significantly more so than before. My vision is extremely blurry for any semi-long distance, and I can barely focus my eyes on anything. I\u2019m becoming more and more depressed and constantly in a state of panic. These are all symptoms I had before, but now it has escalated to a point where I cannot function how I used to, which is extremely bad because this month is extremely important and busy when it comes to school. \n\nI\u2019m a very anxious and somewhat paranoid person, so my brain is typically going overdrive on whatever is stressing me out. I think this is causing my DPDR to be as persistent as it is. This is not without a lack of trying to manage my anxiety, though. I regularly take anxiety relieving herbs like chamomile and lavender, try to practice deep breathing, manage and rationalize my thoughts whenever I can, take breaks when I need to, spend time in nature, etc. My parents are aware of my anxiety as well, though not to the real severity of it. Part of the problem is that the event that triggered my DPDR is unavoidable, I live in an extremely hurricane prone area. And my other obsessive anxious thoughts have been persistent since I was a child. \n\nI am really desperate at this point. I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019ve spent the entirety of my teenage years feeling completely outside of my body. I never mentioned it to adults around me because I had no idea how to even begin to explain it and was very afraid of what their reaction might be or how it might impact their view of me. And now, this has spiraled completely out of my control. Stress management has not worked and I need an alternative treatment. I will talk to them very soon, but this next month is extremely heavy with school and I need a temporary solution to be able to function in the meantime. If anyone could help me, I would appreciate it so much. \n\nEdit: Some distractions like playing a video game seem to help marginally, but I am still very dissociated during it and I cannot rely on that as a solution. It consumes everything I do, even when I\u2019m not consciously thinking about it. I want to be able to spend time with my family and not be overwhelmed by dissociation, which is not possible with the way I currently am. I also intend on never touching weed again, I was never dependent on it to begin with and I cannot risk this getting any worse. ",

The lack of arms didn\u2019t make it any easier.\n\n**\u201cGod fucking dammit.\u201d**\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Orson had taken up cursing as a way to vent his frustrations, it was a day when someone had eaten Mark\u2019s food. The words that he learnt that fateful event was bountiful in both Swedish and English swear words.\n\nThe team had of course not programmed him with swearing, yet the added free will and sapience made learning new things easier. It also provided him with beneficial upsides during combat and scouting missions. Learning patterns, assessing situations and dangers made it all the more easier when he was consciously aware of it all.\n\nHowever he snapped back to reality once his optics turned down towards the organic that was screaming mere moments ago. Shil\u2019vati is what they were called, Eggplants and Shills by his creators, but what was the name of this individual in particular?\n\nSympathy hadn\u2019t been programmed within him, it came later when they made him more intelligent. A component in his core to emulate sympathy and other various human emotions. So when he looked down at what had been a living being, he couldn't help but \u201cfeel\u201d a non-existent chill.\n\nPerhaps he could have spared her, but that had run the risk of the others calling his bluff and running back to finish him off when no great lightning hit.\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d** He quietly muttered before turning his head to look at the other distant corpse, smoke still rising from the charred body as he shakily made his way over. Self-hate was what ran through him at that moment, he wished they\u2019d have just listened, wished that they\u2019d have just walked away, but even he knew it wasn\u2019t that easy. Maybe he could\u2019ve negotiated instead of immediately starting it off with an emp attack, maybe he could\u2019ve done it all differently.\n\nOrson shook his head, bringing himself out of his mind. The steps had already been outlined for him:\n\n\n\n`Retrieve the bodies`\n\n`Retrieve the weapons`\n\n`???`\n\n`Profit`\n\n\n\nThe tasks that Mark sent him after his bout with the Shil\u2019vati would have been easier if he had retained his arms, yet his tail and mouth would have to suffice for now.\n\nWalking back to the complex took more time than it should have, he was already aware of the variables, for one; he was dragging a corpse with his tail, two: he was missing both arms..\n\nHowever the unexpected rumbling and shaking is what set him off, *are they bombing the factory?* He thought.\n\n**\u201cAnyone read me? Who am I connected to?\u201d**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi, and don't think of the rumbling too much.\u201d\n\nHe inwardly sighed, Lexi was a human that he wasn't particularly fond of. She was the one who designed him with spiky silver hair. In his opinion, it made him look weird and old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what you did through your optic feed, nicely done on driving those Eggplants away. All that lightning and shazam and what not! I also want to shoot lightning!\u201d\n\nA pang of mild annoyance shot through him at the compliment. **\u201cThanks, I just had to fry two living sapients. Nothing too bad.\u201d** His artificial voice dripped with sarcasm and a hint of venom, he would have been giving her the stare of her life if it were not for them being on what was by all means; a simple call. Albeit in his head, a call nonetheless.\n\nLexi took notice of his tone, opting to return to business. \u201cEhrm\u2026 anyhow the cameras we have outside are displaying an orbital strike.\u201d She chuckled, Orson however groaned, continuing to drag along the body deeper into the tunnels. \u201cFunny if they think that\u2019ll work, unless they plan to blast a 2 km deep hole into the ea-\u201d\n\n**\u201cAlright, alright quit running your mouth, I\u2019ll be there soon, so be sure to open the damn blast doors when I get there. I\u2019ve got a body alongside one of their rifles.\u201d**\n\nAn unnerving amount of time passed before Lexi answered, her reply short and sly.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know sometimes I forget you aren't even human.\u201d\n\n\u2014------------------------------\n\n*12 hours after the activation of LIBAI.*\n\nHe let go of the crispy corpse and rifle once he arrived inside. The blast doors closed behind him, sounding with a heavy thud that reverberated in the main hub of the complex.\n\n\u201cOrson! Well done budd-\u201d Mark alongside Lexi and a few others that had come to greet him immediately gagged at the smell of the charred corpse.\n\nOrson on the other hand remained utterly unbothered, his artificial sense of smell worked differently to theirs. Repulsive smells were not disgusting to him, they were simply scents that had a different taste to them.\n\n**\u201cYeah, yeah, quit gagging. I need two new limbs.\u201d** He bluntly said, the others were quick to cover their noses with whatever they had. Two of the humans grabbed each side of the corpse, lifting it up and ferrying it away.\n\nLexi however was quick to snatch the laser rifle, immediately attempting to shoot it at a wall to which Mark yelled out in anger.\n\n**\u201cThe weapon is short-circuited, also overheated. Not to mention it has a bio-lock, so you can't necessarily use it, Lexi.\u201d** Orson was quick to interject, his tail snatching away the rifle and promptly handing it to a disgruntled Mark.\n\n\u201cParty-pooper..\u201d She grumbled, walking off. Orson in the meanwhile tilted his head, confused at her lack of knowledge. Though he couldn't blame her, she had been holed up here for quite a while.\n\nMark turned his attention to Orson once more. \u201cAnyhow, Orson, get yourself to Raphael. You look like shit and...\u201d\n\n**\u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d**\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gone bald.\u201d\n\n**\u201cThank fuck.\u201d**\n\nOrson sighed with relief, happy to be rid of the godforsaken hair. Mark and him parted shortly after, but as it turns out, finding Raphael was easier said than done. Despite being connected to the entire complex and its security cameras, finding the man was frustratingly hard.\n\nIn a last ditch attempt to find the guy, he walked through the hallway that held most of their private quarters, the only place that he wasn't connected to and had zero cameras.\n\nA few twists and turns here and there and eventually he found the room with the man tinkering on a new project. The space was sizable, equipment lay strewn about and the only moderately homey thing about it was a tv, a couch that Lana was snoring on and a bunk bed in the corner where Orson could make out the contours of Simon dead asleep.\n\n**\u201cRaphael, I need a few repairs.\u201d**\n\nThe Kenyan turned his head, nearly flying backwards at the horrifying sight of Orson.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, what happened to you? You\u2019re all burnt and armless\u2026 and bald!\u201d\n\n**\u201cShit happens, can you fix it?\u201d** He nonchalantly replied, less than concerned for his well-being. He\u2019s only a machine after all, any and every part of him aside from the core can be remade and repaired if damaged or gone.\n\nRaphael sighed in disbelief, gesturing to the Geri chair beside his table. \u201cOf course I can, you\u2019re lucky I have spares leftover. Decouple your tail first though and retract those damn spikes.\u201d\n\nHe sat down after the decoupling, leaning back into the softness. His sensors were wonderful, allowing him to interact with the world more immersively than he had when he was first constructed.\n\nRaphael scooted over to him with his office chair, an overbed table with equipment stood to the side as the African fellow began doing his magic. Hanging the arm in place with a mechanical appendage that hung from the ceiling. He started with the wires first, wires that acted like organic nerves, sending signals to the limbs. Soldering them together was an easy feat for the Kenyan.\n\nWelding, soldering and anything else that had to do with electronics and hardware was something that Raphael had studied and worked on for nearly two decades before the Shil\u2019vati arrived. Before he found and joined LiBAI.\n\n*\u2018****Li****beration. By. Artificial. Intelligence\u2019* or *\u2018LiBAI\u2019* for short, was both the name they had given to their super AI and the name to their little organization.\n\nHe thought it was clever, not because he himself was a large contributor to the name, but because of the fond memories he held when he and the team were still getting to learn and know about each other.\n\nOrson suddenly coughed, faking the sound so as to snap Raphael out of his thoughts.\n\n\u201cUh.. so\u2026 I assume your fight with the Shils went well?\u201d Raphael asked, making sure not to inhale the fumes as he continued soldering wires together.\n\nOrson watched the man intently, Raphael's fingers deftly moved, slowly connecting the arm to him. **\u201cIt went as well as you would expect. The shil\u2019vati aren't necessarily pushovers by any means. They blasted my arms off as if they were jelly.\u201d**\n\n\u201cYet you won, didn't you?\u201d\n\nRaphael\u2019s rhetorical question hung in the air as he awaited the synth\u2019s response, Orson did hold a little pride in his victory but it was overshadowed by the guilt that kept gnawing at him. Sometimes he wondered why he was even cursed with sympathy or empathy. It felt pointless when all it did was drag him down.\n\n**\u201cI did, that much is true. But I\u2026 I don\u2019t know man. It doesn\u2019t feel as good as I thought It would.\u201d**\n\n\u201cWhy is that? You won your first battle outside of a simulation.\u201d His words did little to comfort Orson, the synth sighed. Turning to look Raphael in the eyes.\n\n**\u201cI feel like I could\u2019ve done better, y\u2019know? I know that we aren't supposed to necessarily spare them or feel any form of remorse towards the invaders but I can't help but feel bad. Why was I given human emotions if all they do is make me feel worse?\u201d**\n\n\u201cBecause emotions help us survive, you may be a machine but you're made to be human too. You're practically a man, just more.. steel, do you get what I\u2019m trying to say? Empathy is needed because some enemies need to be spared, they can be interrogated later and hey, you might end up getting a new friend or\u2026 nevermind heh.\u201d Raphael awkwardly smiled before sighing in dejection.\n\n\u201cListen, you did well\u2026 you won! That's what matters. The Shils you killed\u2026 I get it, shit\u2019s tough. Mark and the others may have made it very clear to you that they are not to be spared but hey\u2026\u201d\n\nHe leaned in, whispering regardless or not if anyone was to actually hear them.\n\n\u201cBetween you and me? Spare them when you can. Murder doesn't have to be the solution.\u201d\n\nOrson nodded, its moments like these that made it worthwhile to continue existing. Seeing the complicated mess that is life and the different people within it, Raphael was a human he was glad to have met.\n\n**\u201c...Thank you.\u201d**\n\nTheir short moment of deep interaction came to an end once Orson felt the new sensations of his arm coming to life. \u201cHey, is it connected? Try wiggling your fingers.\u201d\n\nOrson did as said, moving the digits on the new appendage one by one.\n\n**\u201cYes, I can feel it.\u201d**\n\nRaphael finally went on with coupling the arm completely, setting it in place properly. \u201cThere you go, I wish I could just up and replace my limbs.\u201d The fellow lightly laughed.\n\nOrson raised a brow at that. **\u201cYou can though, creating prosthetics shouldn\u2019t be beneath the expertise of our team.\u201d**\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. But that wouldn\u2019t be the real thing.\u201d Raphael shrugged, scooting over to the other side of the Geri Chair.\n\nThe synth inwardly grumbled, *What's the difference anyways? It would be an upgrade if anything.* His thoughts ran rampant as he struggled to understand what Raphael meant, he wasn\u2019t much aware of the attachments humans had, whether or not they were ridiculous.\n\n\u201cHave you spoken with Libai?\u201d Raphael asked, bringing Orson out of his mind.\n\n**\u201cNot really\u2026 I haven't, we\u2019ve been connected to the same network and servers... yet I haven't really reached out to them and neither have they to me.\u201d**\n\n\u201cWell then, why don't you go ahead and speak with them? I\u2019ll keep working on your arm so go ahead, you have all the time in the world.\u201d Raphael\u2019s reassuring smile eased some of Orson\u2019s tension, prompting a nod from the Synth.\n\n**\u201cAlright.\u201d**\n\n\u2014------------------------------\n\nWooo, another one is out!

        "selftext": "Leona tended to stick to a certain sleep schedule, that being one that fit her job as a bouncer and closet monster hunter, which resulted in lights out at about five a.m. That meant she slept in late every day, though it wasn\u2019t that difficult considering she was often satisfied with a paltry six hours of sleep. For that reason, going over any research with her partners until 10 p.m. would leave her in the middle of her day off.\n\nThe sleep habits she currently had were because of her years in the military, training her body to work when she needed to and sleep when she could. That prompted her to put her phone on Do Not Disturb at night, but with the filter that let through people in her phone\u2019s Favorites.\n\nThat next morning, she was woken by her phone about nine a.m. and quickly shook herself awake and cleared her throat before she glanced at the caller I.D. and answered. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wake you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, this is the time boring people wake up.\u201d She stretched as she sat up in bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nLeona knew that anyone who knew her well was aware of her lack of toleration for small talk. Conversations on the phone fulfilled a purpose and asking how the other person had been doing was a waste of time, unless that was the purpose of the call. She didn\u2019t care for small talk, caring took effort, and it made her feel like a puppet mouthing along to a conversation someone else was having, conversations that all sounded identical in her mind.\n\nThe man on the other end of the line, Arian Valencia, was former army like Leona and they\u2019d worked together for several years. These days, he worked as a private investigator, and Leona knew he was damn good at his job. Aside from that, they knew each other through a no-strings-attached arrangement they\u2019d had for going on a year, which also made her appreciate him on a whole other level.\n\n\u201cI wanted to ask a favor,\u201d Arian replied. \u201cCould you pull babysitting duty starting this afternoon, for like a day?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the case?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom and two daughters, six and three, being stalked by the husband, violating a restraining order,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering the family with my cameras and got the evidence that can get her custody of the kids so she can get away from the bastard, but you know the courts; it\u2019s gonna take a while. Mom and the girls are gonna head up to Maine to stay with family for a bit, but the flight doesn\u2019t leave until tomorrow morning. I just want to get some things in order, not to mention get a good night\u2019s sleep, before escorting them to the airport. I\u2019ll foot the bill to have you there, so don\u2019t tell them what you cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d Leona was edging toward wide awake at this point and slid out of bed, heading out to her kitchen, turning on lights as she went. \u201cWhy a babysitter? You think he\u2019s gonna throw a tantrum when they fly the coop?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to go stay with family was just made yesterday, and I caught him doing drive-bys,\u201d Arian said. \u201cAnd he started calling the home line again, probably hoping to get the older daughter to pick up. I\u2019m just worried the guy found out about the flight plans somehow and sees his kids being taken from him.\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head as she went into the fridge, taking out a carton of orange juice, holding the phone with her shoulder as she poured a tall glass. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but there\u2019s a reason you called me. Spit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s former Spec Ops,\u201d Arian sighed.\n\nThe glass of orange juice stopped halfway to her lips, and she put it down on the counter. \u201cKinda buried the lede there, Ari, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. This whole thing started when he got caught up with what we\u2019d call \u2018the wrong crowd\u2019, wanting to move the family to a survivalist compound. For a while it seemed like as long as I kept an eye on the mom and her girls it was enough, but this feels like an escalation, and I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just paranoia and they\u2019ll be able to just hop on the plane and get away from this guy, but I trust you to keep them safe until then. The money\u2019s shit since I can only afford you by the hour, you know that, and I know you\u2019ll need to call out of work at Shayde, but I\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d\n\nLeona pursed her lips thoughtfully before taking a few large gulps of juice. \u201cI haven\u2019t called out of work short notice for like six months, so they\u2019ll call in a freelancer and make do for the night. Throw in a bottle of Hennessy cognac and you\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d\n\nArian chuckled. \u201cYeah, deal. As long as I get an inch of it the next time I\u2019m at your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways gotta get your kickback, huh? All right, I\u2019m in. Send me the details and I\u2019ll pack a bag.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt about four p.m., parking her black sedan on the street in front of the two-story, single-family home, Leona grabbed her duffel bag from the back seat before locking the car and taking a few steps toward the house. She paused, taking it in, circling to the right a bit. Not exactly something she would consider a home built with security in mind.\n\nRoof access from a tree in a neighboring yard, and from there you could get in through at least two windows. Leona continued up the empty driveway, assuming the car was in the garage. The front door looked standard, though not low-quality. The suburbs encouraged attentive lawn care, though, so at least the windows weren\u2019t covered in overgrowth and large, unkempt trees didn\u2019t hover overhead. If she looked at it objectively, it was bright and cheerful, a great place to raise a family.\n\nAt least there was a security system in place. Arian had given her a summary of what kind of system they\u2019d had, but in the back of her mind she was mulling over the fact that this was a home, not a military installation, and wondered how long it would take a security expert to crack it wide open. They would have their choice of five different ways in, and she\u2019d guess it would take them under three minutes.\n\nLeona rang the doorbell, waiting patiently with her duffel slung over her shoulder, turning as her eyes scanned the surrounding area. Things that looked suspicious were one thing, and to be honest, she knew those weren\u2019t what she was looking for. Their guy would be smarter than that. What she needed to do was get a lay of the land, the way things looked, and keep track of anything that changed.\n\nTurning back to the door when it opened, Leona pasted her most personable smile on her face. \u201cHi, Leona Parker, good to meet you,\u201d she said, holding out a hand.\n\nThe woman smiled back, shaking it tightly. \u201cLisa. Thank you so much for coming. Ari\u2019s been so helpful with all of this. I can\u2019t imagine what I would\u2019ve done if I hadn\u2019t found him.\u201d\n\nLeona looked around as she walked inside. The furniture was modern but comfortable, as she\u2019d expect in the home with kids, and the signs of the two young ones were scattered about. Open floor plan, not surprising considering d\u00e9cor trends these days, and that was a tick in the pro column. Fewer corners for an intruder to hide around. Most noticeable were the curtains and Venetian blinds on each window, all tightly shut on the beautiful day.\n\nThere were family photos on the walls and tables (Leona took a good look at dear old dad) and a clear line of sight to the kitchen gave her a view of crayon-drawn and finger-painted artwork. Also, there was a children\u2019s book on the living room coffee table and shoes that fit little feet lay in a staggered row near the entryway. A laptop sat on the dining room table among a few piles of papers, and Leona guessed that was a makeshift office.\n\n\u201cAri said you could take this couch,\u201d Lisa said, motioning to the living room couch as she shut and locked the front door. To her credit, Leona saw her not just flick the lock on the knob, but also engaged the deadbolt and the chain and then reset the security system. \u201cBut that seems a bit uncomfortable since it doesn\u2019t fold out or anything. We\u2019ve got a couch downstairs that folds out.\u201d\n\nLeona was already shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m here for security, Ms. Bowman, and that means staying present, not out of the way. And trust me, I\u2019ve gotten a good night\u2019s sleep on cement floors. This is fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lisa, please. But if you insist, the couch is yours.\u201d As she put her duffel down on the couch, Leona continued to survey her surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ll show you around,\u201d Lisa said, motioning to the areas around them. \u201cLiving room, dining, kitchen. Rose is still too little to trust with some things, so you\u2019ll see occasional safety precautions.\u201d Leona nodded, her eyes catching on latches on cabinets under the sink.\n\n\u201cYou can feel free to make yourself at home, have anything from the fridge, or order in if you prefer. There\u2019s not much there, since we\u2019re planning on leaving tomorrow,\u201d Lisa said as they walked over the threshold to the kitchen as Leona took note of each magnetized security clip on each window.\n\nLeona followed the woman to their right, into the den that had two small couches situated perpendicular to each other and a TV opposite one of them, playing a show on Nickelodeon. \u201cBathroom is here. And then we\u2019ve got the den. Girls, say hi to our new guest. This is Leona.\u201d\n\nShannon, the older at six years old, was the first to shift her attention from the television to Leona. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Shannon, this is Rose,\u201d she said, hopping over from her seat on the beige couch, her blonde hair bouncing around her as she did so. Rose was sat on the floor next to the coffee table and looked up curiously but didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWe\u2019re watching The Loud House. You ever seen it?\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head. \u201cNah, must\u2019ve been after my time. I\u2019m more of a Spongebob girl,\u201d she said. A half-truth, since the television was almost always on a channel dictated by her father, and as a child, she spent as much time in her bedroom as possible anyway. In her line of work, Leona rarely interacted with children in this manner and her gaze went back and forth between the girls, something in the back of her mind curious of their lives, so radically different than hers.\n\n\u201cSo, what did I tell you, Shannon? Why\u2019s Leona here?\u201d Lisa asked.\n\n\u201cFor a sleepover!\u201d Shannon said excitedly with another leap into the air. \u201cWe\u2019re getting pizza, right?\u201d\n\nLisa nodded. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re good, and that means letting the grown-ups do grown-up stuff.\u201d\n\nShannon nodded and glanced to her sister, whose attention was back to the coloring book in front of her, a green crayon in her hand and her tongue poking out of her mouth in concentration. Then Shannon moved closer to the two adults in front of her. \u201cRose doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with Daddy,\u201d she said to Leona quietly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s not allowed back here. And why Ari\u2019s been spying on us, and why we need a babysitter.\u201d\n\nLeona glanced to Lisa, whose face had fallen a bit, and the woman crouched down in front of her daughter. \u201cBut you\u2019re a big girl, right?\u201d Lisa said softly. \u201cYou know Daddy\u2019s sick in his head, he\u2019s scary now. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a vacation with Granny and Pop Pop.\u201d Shannon nodded.\n\nAbsorbing the dynamic between the two of them, Leona categorized and sorted it in her mind, and mirrored Lisa, crouching down beside her. \u201cWhat kind of things do you differently now?\u201d Leona asked the young girl.\n\nShannon shifted back and forth on her feet thoughtfully. \u201cWindows and doors gotta always stay closed and locked. And we need Mommy\u2019s permission to go play in the backyard. If we just go out, the alarm goes off and it\u2019s *loud*,\u201d she said with a grimace and a glance toward the door that led outside, revealing that she had made that particular mistake. \u201cAnd if we ever see Daddy, if we\u2019re out doing stuff or if I\u2019m at school, I gotta tell Mommy, or a teacher.\u201d\n\nLeona nodded slowly. \u201cThis is big girl stuff but sounds like you\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d\n\nShannon smiled proudly.\n\nThe two adults left the kids to their devices and Lisa led the way to the basement, flicking the light switch as she went. \u201cThe kids play down here sometimes, but it\u2019s mostly storage,\u201d she said. \u201cThat couch I mentioned, over there, we use for guests. Just one window over there, to meet fire code standards. It\u2019s covered by the security system, of course.\u201d Leona nodded, following her back up the stairs and then up to the second floor.\n\n\u201cThe bathroom right here is one that we all use, my bedroom\u2019s attached, and the girls are there and there,\u201d Lisa continued.\n\nLeona took a glance out the bathroom window for a bird\u2019s-eye view of the backyard, also noticing the overhang of the roof from the back part of the house. But as was the case with the other windows, they were locked and hooked up to the security system. Lisa showed her through the mildly messy bedrooms of her daughters and then the master, and Leona took in everything she saw, cataloguing it and storing it away.\n\nThey headed back downstairs and stopped in the living room, Lisa letting out a nervous sigh and clasping her hands in front of her. \u201cSo, how does this work? Do you\u2026scout the perimeter regularly and such?\u201d she asked, managing a tight smile at the effort of a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep track of the interior mostly,\u201d Leona told her. \u201cNo use in constantly disarming the security system. And we\u2019ve got those four cameras on the house perimeter, so I\u2019ll check those regularly to make sure they\u2019re still operational, see what\u2019s what. I just need Wi-Fi access. Ari gave me what I need to access the cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Lisa folded her arms. \u201cI do most of my work in the dining room, data entry stuff, pretty boring. Can I get you anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just chill on the couch,\u201d Leona replied. \u201cI\u2019ve got my Sudoku book to kill time. And ideally, tomorrow morning will arrive, we\u2019ll get you on your way, and this will\u2019ve all been a boring waste of time.\u201d\n\nLisa smiled, some tension loosening from her shoulders. \u201cRight. Okay. But still, let me know if you need anything.\u201d\n\nLeona did another thorough sweep of the house, getting a better sense of the security system and the coverage of the cameras outside. She knew Arian had installed them, so they were well-placed with few blind spots. Repetition was the key to getting familiar with the lay of the land wherever you were, so she focused on that.\n\nOnce she was satisfied, she took a Sudoku book from her duffel and spent an hour or so solving puzzles. She set her phone to emit a soft tone every fifteen minutes, prompting her to check each of the camera feeds on her laptop. Eventually she switched to a book of cryptograms.\n\nAt about 6:30, Lisa asked for Leona\u2019s preference on pizza, and she replied that she was partial to pepperoni. They ordered in and Leona met the driver at the door, giving her a quick thanks before shutting the door and resetting the alarm. The family and Leona ate at the kitchen table, the conversation dominated by Shannon\u2019s rapid-fire discussion of things Leona had very little familiarity with. Rose also piped in on occasion and Leona considered whether the child was particularly advanced for her age or if three-year-olds commonly spoke as well as she did.\n\nLeona had no recollection of those younger years, so she had nothing to compare it to, but she assumed that her lack of memories was probably for the best.\n\nThe sounds of impending bedtime echoed through the house at about 8 p.m. and Leona found herself distracted from the puzzle book in her hands. The bond she\u2019d formed with Penelope and Eliza was the closest she\u2019d come to anything she\u2019d ever considered a real family, and she felt, to a certain extent, like she was participating in the recording of a television sitcom. Everything was so normal. But, as she did with the rest of her life among other people, she held steadily to her chosen affable, calm persona through the evening.\n\nEventually, once the girls had been put to bed, Leona and Lisa found themselves in the living room, Lisa on her laptop in the loveseat angled toward the coffee table in front of Leona\u2019s sofa, sitting in silence. \u201cDo you do this sort of work a lot?\u201d Lisa suddenly spoke up, lifting Leona\u2019s gaze from her book. \u201cLike\u2026body-guarding?\u201d\n\n\u201cI work freelance sometimes, yeah,\u201d Leona responded. \u201cMostly I work as a bouncer at a club downtown.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you enjoy it?\u201d\n\nLeona paused. \u201cAh, yeah. Keeps my mind busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas this been really boring, then?\u201d Lisa asked with a grimace.\n\n\u201cNo, just part of the job,\u201d Leona told her with a shake of the head. \u201cThat\u2019s what the books are for. Human minds wander, it\u2019s unavoidable, so the strategy is to manage it. And to a certain extent, you change your brain over time so you experience less of it. There have been plenty of times I really needed to stay aware of everything for hours at a time and that takes more effort.\u201d\n\nLisa nodded slowly and Leona realized the woman probably found the former soldier\u2019s life as interesting as she herself found the odd banality of family life. They lapsed into silence for a while longer, Leona continuing to check the cameras at fifteen-minute intervals, or when her peripheral vision caught one of them light up as the floodlights chased away the darkness. The cameras were decent, but not exactly top of the line, so the occasional brightness helped her determine that the culprit was something nocturnal out hunting for dinner.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Leona\u2019s eyes flicked to the ceiling as she heard a *thump*. But looking to Lisa to gauge her reaction, she just saw resignation. \u201cThat will be Shannon,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened for a couple years, but the past month she\u2019s had\u2026maybe it\u2019s nightmares, maybe it\u2019s a child\u2019s imagination, but she suspects a monster under her bed. The landing you just heard was her jumping away from her bed, lest her ankles be caught.\u201d\n\nLeona listened as the floorboards creaked, revealing that Shannon was making her way down the second-floor hallway and then to the stairs. The military folder in her mind opened, in which she kept her other job divided and organized away from the rest of the world. \u201cDid she describe the monster?\u201d\n\nShaking her head, Lisa put her laptop on the coffee table and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s just a worry, a typical childhood fear.\u201d Leona nodded, flicking through her knowledge like a library\u2019s card catalog, her mind settling on an extremely low probability of this being anything more than a child expressing stress in a way her brain could process. Penelope had discussed this side of her job at length, sorting the dangerous monsters from the imagined as a psychologist, and like her friend, Leona had developed methods of discerning one from the other.\n\nLisa lowered her voice as Shannon\u2019s footsteps were heard coming down the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s never even described anything. Therapist says it\u2019s her mind dealing with having her father as a dangerous figure in her life\u2026 Hey honey,\u201d she spoke up, walking toward the stairs. \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the monster under the bed,\u201d Shannon said earnestly. \u201cIt feels really scary right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really think it\u2019s a monster?\u201d Lisa asked, crouching down in front of her daughter. \u201cOr does it just feel like a monster, like Doctor Gloeckner talked about?\u201d\n\nShannon hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s just scary.\u201d\n\nLeona found a thought building in her mind and she pursed her lips at it contemplatively. \u201cHey, Shannon. You think you\u2019d feel safer with some monster protection?\u201d\n\nShannon eyed her warily. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\nLeona glanced to the girl\u2019s mother, gauging her reaction, and seeing only curiosity. \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have monsters. I\u2019m a security expert, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, right?\u201d Shannon nodded. \u201cBut monsters can\u2019t cross salt lines. The hate salt, all monsters do. So, how about we put one of those in front of your bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we?\u201d Shannon asked, turning to her mother.\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Lisa looked to Leona. \u201cBugs\u2026don\u2019t like salt, do they?\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head as she stood up, sticking a pencil in the page she\u2019d left off on and then putting the book on the coffee table. \u201cAnts, maybe. But it won\u2019t be a problem just for one night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right then\u2026sure. I\u2019ll get the container from the kitchen.\u201d\n\nLeona watched as Shannon visibly relaxed from the incoming backup and Lisa fetched a container of Morton salt, with the familiar logo of a girl with an umbrella front and center. The three of them then went back up to the bedroom and Shannon hung back as Leona opened the flap on the container, pouring a long line from the girl\u2019s bedside table to almost the end of the bed frame.\n\n\u201cOkay. Hop up, see how it feels,\u201d Leona said, closing the flap with a flick of her fingers. She left the container on the girl\u2019s bedside table, in case she decided she wanted to improve her security setup later.\n\nShannon approached the bed, ducking her head down to peek underneath, before lifting herself up onto the mattress. She nodded. \u201cThat helps. I can tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Leona said with a nod. She glanced to Lisa who met her gaze, looking grateful. Leona gave her a tight smile, turning and leaving the room, hearing the mother say, \u201cSweet dreams, honey,\u201d before she left. The two went back down the hallway and down the stairs to the living room.\n\n\u201cThat was ingenious,\u201d Lisa remarked. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn that?\u201d\n\n*Trapping and killing monsters that prey on children like yours.* Leona hesitated. \u201cI was a kid once too,\u201d she finally answered, reclaiming her seat on the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s just the placebo effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s greatly appreciated.\u201d Lisa sighed. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll be able to move on once all this is\u2026over.\u201d Her gaze went distant before she picked up her laptop, resuming whatever she\u2019d been doing. Likewise, Leona resumed her work on the challenging cryptograms in her book.\n\nThe surprise of an imaginary monster under the bed, which Leona found quite a nice break from a real one, was what she\u2019d expected to be the most excitement they had all night. And yet, in the back of her mind, she continued to skim through the file she\u2019d received on Harvey Bowman. The man had slipped off the edge a while ago and, while Lisa had been smart to put her children\u2019s safety first, there was only a certain amount they could do. A formidable opponent like this guy wasn\u2019t deterred easily, Leona knew.\n\nWhen the doorbell rang at about an hour later, Leona was on her feet, her book discarded beside her on the sofa, taking the gun from the holster in the small of her back.\n\n\u201cHe-He wouldn\u2019t-\u201d Lisa took a breath to steady herself and Leona saw blatant fear in her eyes, but also confusion. \u201cHe knows if he comes here, I\u2019ll call the police. He\u2019s not allowed-\u201d\n\n\u201cI got this, just stay calm,\u201d Leona told her. Lisa nodded, but got up from her seat also, taking a few wary steps in the direction of the front door.\n\nLeona motioned for the woman to stay in place as she pulled the living room curtain aside to take a peek out at the street. Her eyes narrowed at the idling sedan at the curb, an illuminated sign on top for Dominos. They\u2019d ordered from them that evening, but there hadn\u2019t been any mistakes in their order that would\u2019ve required another trip. Walking over to the door, Leona looked through the peephole, the porchlight revealing a young man holding a pizza box and a bottle of soda.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t order pizza,\u201d Leona shouted through the door.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026this is 154 Hardgrave, isn\u2019t it? Do you have a kid who might\u2019ve ordered it? I need payment in cash.\u201d\n\nHesitant but knowing she needed to make a choice, Leona unlocked the door and then pressed the buttons to disarm the security system. She got clear of the door\u2019s path before she opened it a foot or so, her gun hidden behind her back. \u201cWhen was the order put in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe usually make it in about half an hour on weekdays,\u201d the man answered. He looked over the receipt again. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Regina Williamson.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lisa exclaimed with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s my neighbor. You must have a typo. She\u2019s 158, next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cGotcha, thanks!\u201d the man said with a grin. \u201cHope I didn\u2019t wake anyone!\u201d he called before heading back the way he\u2019d come.\n\nLeona stared after him, her gaze still wary, her stance still tight. But no one else approached the front door, so she closed it, locked it thoroughly, and reset the alarm. \u201cAll right, hopefully-\u201d She\u2019d turned around to see a man, gun pointed straight at her, having come through the hallway from the den. Lisa noticed and followed her gaze, letting out a shriek and stumbling toward Leona.\n\nLeona gnashed her teeth together, cursing her stupidity. All he\u2019d needed was to pick the lock on the back door, wait for the alarm to be turned off, and make his entrance before it reengaged. An oversight of this magnitude was embarrassing, and she knew immediately she wouldn\u2019t be able to bring herself to charge Ari even for her hourly rate. She\u2019d utterly failed at her job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Leona said calmly.\n\nHarvey Bowman\u2019s face showed nothing but anger and resentment, and he ignored her warning. \u201cPut down the gun. Kick it away.\u201d\n\nLeona took a breath and let it out, irritated, before doing as she was told, though she kept track of where it landed, under the coffee table. She took in his stance, practiced and steady, an easy but firm two-handed grip on his weapon. He had decent trigger discipline at least, his index finger hovering outside the trigger guard. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Leona asked. \u201cMake a run for the border? You\u2019ll never be able to hide these kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding them,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m protecting them.\u201d He gave her a once-over. \u201cYou look former military. You\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s happening to this country. My family is the most important thing to me, and no matter what anyone else does to try to take them away from me, I\u2019m keeping them safe.\u201d\n\nHarvey took one of his hands off the gun, pulling two sets of plastic zip-tie handcuffs from his jacket and tossing them to Leona. \u201cFor both of you. Do her first, then you.\u201d\n\nFury started to churn in Leona\u2019s stomach. There were few things she hated than being made a fool of but letting down two kids that had been counting on her for protection rated right at the top of the list. Her mind flipped through any options she might have, bouncing around any mistakes Harvey could make over the next few minutes. She still had two knives on her and, while using them as weapons was tricky, especially cuffed, she could easily slash a tire of his getaway vehicle when he tried to take off.\n\n\u201cPlease, Harvey, they\u2019re my babies,\u201d Lisa whimpered, tears starting to stream from her eyes as Leona put the cuffs on. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t take them from me. You\u2019re wrong, they\u2019re not in danger, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea,\u201d Harvey scoffed at his ex-wife. He nodded at the second set of cuffs in encouragement, prompting Lisa to put them on Leona. \u201cOver here, now,\u201d he said, motioning with his gun. He gave them a wide berth as they exchanged places, leaving him closer to the front door and them on the threshold of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhat now, Harvey?\u201d Leona asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go get your kids. You really going to hurt the mother of your children?\u201d\n\nHarvey glowered at her. \u201cNo one needs to get hurt.\u201d He took half a step toward the stairwell. \u201cShannon? It\u2019s Daddy! Can you come downstairs?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Leona told him.\n\n\u201cAfter the doorbell, and hearing her mother scream?\u201d he asked, cocking his head at her expectantly. Leona didn\u2019t respond, just listened carefully until they heard soft footsteps making their way down the stairs.\n\nShannon slowly came out from behind the wall that lined the stairwell. \u201cDaddy, just go away,\u201d she said shakily, looking from her father to her mother and Leona as she continued down each step slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping you safe, sweetheart,\u201d he said gently. Leona absently wondered if his tone was fake, if everything about him was fake, or if he really did still care about his daughters. Whether he was trying not to scare her because that was important to him, or because it would be easier to handle them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to a safe place, you and me and your sister. I need you to go get her, okay? I\u2019ve got everything you need. Just make sure Rose has her blankie, of course. And you can choose a teddy bear.\u201d\n\nShannon\u2019s lower lip quivered in fear, but Leona saw a stiffness to her spine, a determination, as she walked closer to him instead of back up the stairs. \u201cYou don\u2019t keep us safe. You scare us. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t live here anymore. Just go away!\u201d\n\nHarvey\u2019s patience faded a bit. \u201cI\u2019m your father, and you\u2019re going to listen to me. Go get. Your sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re my father!\u201d Shannon shouted. \u201cI think you\u2019re a monster! And I know how to get rid of monsters!\u201d At that, her fists, which Leona hadn\u2019t noticed had been clenched the whole time, flung two handfuls of salt directly at her father\u2019s face.\n\nIt took about a quarter of a second for Leona to comprehend what had happened and then another quarter second to evaluate the sudden shift in the situation and to take advantage of it. In the instant that Harvey\u2019s eyes shut and he cried out and flinched at the salt crystals blinding and pain distracting him, Leona lurched forward with two lengthy steps. She leapt into the air as she reached him, grabbing the gun with her handcuffed hands as she went and shoving the barrel upwards in case it went off as she slammed her knee into his chest.\n\nThey flew back from the force and collapsed to the ground hard, with Leona keeping her bent knee stiff and sharp, like doing a corkscrew into the deep end of a pool. She felt something crack under the force when they landed. The additional disorientation and pain Harvey had to deal with gave Leona the opportunity to wrest the gun from the man\u2019s hand and take a few steps back to point it at him, steadily aiming at center mass.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lisa gasped, rushing to her daughter\u2019s side. Leona didn\u2019t move her gaze from the man who was moaning in pain, still just desperately trying to clear his vision. \u201cShannon, are you okay? Jesus Christ.\u201d Out of the corner of her eye, Leona saw the woman embrace her daughter, lifting her handcuffed hands over the child\u2019s head to do so. Leona took that moment to tell Harvey to roll onto his stomach and to interlock his fingers behind his head.\n\n\u201cMy eyes. Oh god, my eyes-\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, get over yourself, shithead,\u201d Leona growled.\n\n\u201cShe said a bad word!\u201d Shannon exclaimed.\n\nLeona smirked faintly as Lisa spoke, \u201cShe did, she absolutely did, but that\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[EU\\] My book [Closet Terrors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBD4R884)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AuthorKarenAvizur/About)\n\n[Amazon Author Page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B07BPF2VQY)\n\n/r/storiesbykaren",

        "selftext": "Leona tended to stick to a certain sleep schedule, that being one that fit her job as a bouncer and closet monster hunter, which resulted in lights out at about five a.m. That meant she slept in late every day, though it wasn\u2019t that difficult considering she was often satisfied with a paltry six hours of sleep. For that reason, going over any research with her partners until 10 p.m. would leave her in the middle of her day off.\n\nThe sleep habits she currently had were because of her years in the military, training her body to work when she needed to and sleep when she could. That prompted her to put her phone on Do Not Disturb at night, but with the filter that let through people in her phone\u2019s Favorites.\n\nThat next morning, she was woken by her phone about nine a.m. and quickly shook herself awake and cleared her throat before she glanced at the caller I.D. and answered. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wake you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, this is the time boring people wake up.\u201d She stretched as she sat up in bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nLeona knew that anyone who knew her well was aware of her lack of toleration for small talk. Conversations on the phone fulfilled a purpose and asking how the other person had been doing was a waste of time, unless that was the purpose of the call. She didn\u2019t care for small talk, caring took effort, and it made her feel like a puppet mouthing along to a conversation someone else was having, conversations that all sounded identical in her mind.\n\nThe man on the other end of the line, Arian Valencia, was former army like Leona and they\u2019d worked together for several years. These days, he worked as a private investigator, and Leona knew he was damn good at his job. Aside from that, they knew each other through a no-strings-attached arrangement they\u2019d had for going on a year, which also made her appreciate him on a whole other level.\n\n\u201cI wanted to ask a favor,\u201d Arian replied. \u201cCould you pull babysitting duty starting this afternoon, for like a day?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the case?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom and two daughters, six and three, being stalked by the husband, violating a restraining order,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering the family with my cameras and got the evidence that can get her custody of the kids so she can get away from the bastard, but you know the courts; it\u2019s gonna take a while. Mom and the girls are gonna head up to Maine to stay with family for a bit, but the flight doesn\u2019t leave until tomorrow morning. I just want to get some things in order, not to mention get a good night\u2019s sleep, before escorting them to the airport. I\u2019ll foot the bill to have you there, so don\u2019t tell them what you cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d Leona was edging toward wide awake at this point and slid out of bed, heading out to her kitchen, turning on lights as she went. \u201cWhy a babysitter? You think he\u2019s gonna throw a tantrum when they fly the coop?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to go stay with family was just made yesterday, and I caught him doing drive-bys,\u201d Arian said. \u201cAnd he started calling the home line again, probably hoping to get the older daughter to pick up. I\u2019m just worried the guy found out about the flight plans somehow and sees his kids being taken from him.\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head as she went into the fridge, taking out a carton of orange juice, holding the phone with her shoulder as she poured a tall glass. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but there\u2019s a reason you called me. Spit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s former Spec Ops,\u201d Arian sighed.\n\nThe glass of orange juice stopped halfway to her lips, and she put it down on the counter. \u201cKinda buried the lead there, Ari, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. This whole thing started when he got caught up with what we\u2019d call \u2018the wrong crowd\u2019, wanting to move the family to a survivalist compound. For a while it seemed like as long as I kept an eye on the mom and her girls it was enough, but this feels like an escalation, and I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just paranoia and they\u2019ll be able to just hop on the plane and get away from this guy, but I trust you to keep them safe until then. The money\u2019s shit since I can only afford you by the hour, you know that, and I know you\u2019ll need to call out of work at Shayde, but I\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d\n\nLeona pursed her lips thoughtfully before taking a few large gulps of juice. \u201cI haven\u2019t called out of work short notice for like six months, so they\u2019ll call in a freelancer and make do for the night. Throw in a bottle of Hennessy cognac and you\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d\n\nArian chuckled. \u201cYeah, deal. As long as I get an inch of it the next time I\u2019m at your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways gotta get your kickback, huh? All right, I\u2019m in. Send me the details and I\u2019ll pack a bag.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt about four p.m., parking her black sedan on the street in front of the two-story, single-family home, Leona grabbed her duffel bag from the back seat before locking the car and taking a few steps toward the house. She paused, taking it in, circling to the right a bit. Not exactly something she would consider a home built with security in mind.\n\nRoof access from a tree in a neighboring yard, and from there you could get in through at least two windows. Leona continued up the empty driveway, assuming the car was in the garage. The front door looked standard, though not low-quality. The suburbs encouraged attentive lawn care, though, so at least the windows weren\u2019t covered in overgrowth and large, unkempt trees didn\u2019t hover overhead. If she looked at it objectively, it was bright and cheerful, a great place to raise a family.\n\nAt least there was a security system in place. Arian had given her a summary of what kind of system they\u2019d had, but in the back of her mind she was mulling over the fact that this was a home, not a military installation, and wondered how long it would take a security expert to crack it wide open. They would have their choice of five different ways in, and she\u2019d guess it would take them under three minutes.\n\nLeona rang the doorbell, waiting patiently with her duffel slung over her shoulder, turning as her eyes scanned the surrounding area. Things that looked suspicious were one thing, and to be honest, she knew those weren\u2019t what she was looking for. Their guy would be smarter than that. What she needed to do was get a lay of the land, the way things looked, and keep track of anything that changed.\n\nTurning back to the door when it opened, Leona pasted her most personable smile on her face. \u201cHi, Leona Parker, good to meet you,\u201d she said, holding out a hand.\n\nThe woman smiled back, shaking it tightly. \u201cLisa. Thank you so much for coming. Ari\u2019s been so helpful with all of this. I can\u2019t imagine what I would\u2019ve done if I hadn\u2019t found him.\u201d\n\nLeona looked around as she walked inside. The furniture was modern but comfortable, as she\u2019d expect in the home with kids, and the signs of the two young ones were scattered about. Open floor plan, not surprising considering d\u00e9cor trends these days, and that was a tick in the pro column. Fewer corners for an intruder to hide around. Most noticeable were the curtains and Venetian blinds on each window, all tightly shut on the beautiful day.\n\nThere were family photos on the walls and tables (Leona took a good look at dear old dad) and a clear line of sight to the kitchen gave her a view of crayon-drawn and finger-painted artwork. Also, there was a children\u2019s book on the living room coffee table and shoes that fit little feet lay in a staggered row near the entryway. A laptop sat on the dining room table among a few piles of papers, and Leona guessed that was a makeshift office.\n\n\u201cAri said you could take this couch,\u201d Lisa said, motioning to the living room couch as she shut and locked the front door. To her credit, Leona saw her not just flick the lock on the knob, but also engaged the deadbolt and the chain and then reset the security system. \u201cBut that seems a bit uncomfortable since it doesn\u2019t fold out or anything. We\u2019ve got a couch downstairs that folds out.\u201d\n\nLeona was already shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m here for security, Ms. Bowman, and that means staying present, not out of the way. And trust me, I\u2019ve gotten a good night\u2019s sleep on cement floors. This is fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lisa, please. But if you insist, the couch is yours.\u201d As she put her duffel down on the couch, Leona continued to survey her surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ll show you around,\u201d Lisa said, motioning to the areas around them. \u201cLiving room, dining, kitchen. Rose is still too little to trust with some things, so you\u2019ll see occasional safety precautions.\u201d Leona nodded, her eyes catching on latches on cabinets under the sink.\n\n\u201cYou can feel free to make yourself at home, have anything from the fridge, or order in if you prefer. There\u2019s not much there, since we\u2019re planning on leaving tomorrow,\u201d Lisa said as they walked over the threshold to the kitchen as Leona took note of each magnetized security clip on each window.\n\nLeona followed the woman to their right, into the den that had two small couches situated perpendicular to each other and a TV opposite one of them, playing a show on Nickelodeon. \u201cBathroom is here. And then we\u2019ve got the den. Girls, say hi to our new guest. This is Leona.\u201d\n\nShannon, the older at six years old, was the first to shift her attention from the television to Leona. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Shannon, this is Rose,\u201d she said, hopping over from her seat on the beige couch, her blonde hair bouncing around her as she did so. Rose was sat on the floor next to the coffee table and looked up curiously but didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWe\u2019re watching The Loud House. You ever seen it?\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head. \u201cNah, must\u2019ve been after my time. I\u2019m more of a Spongebob girl,\u201d she said. A half-truth, since the television was almost always on a channel dictated by her father, and as a child, she spent as much time in her bedroom as possible anyway. In her line of work, Leona rarely interacted with children in this manner and her gaze went back and forth between the girls, something in the back of her mind curious of their lives, so radically different than hers.\n\n\u201cSo, what did I tell you, Shannon? Why\u2019s Leona here?\u201d Lisa asked.\n\n\u201cFor a sleepover!\u201d Shannon said excitedly with another leap into the air. \u201cWe\u2019re getting pizza, right?\u201d\n\nLisa nodded. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re good, and that means letting the grown-ups do grown-up stuff.\u201d\n\nShannon nodded and glanced to her sister, whose attention was back to the coloring book in front of her, a green crayon in her hand and her tongue poking out of her mouth in concentration. Then Shannon moved closer to the two adults in front of her. \u201cRose doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with Daddy,\u201d she said to Leona quietly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s not allowed back here. And why Ari\u2019s been spying on us, and why we need a babysitter.\u201d\n\nLeona glanced to Lisa, whose face had fallen a bit, and the woman crouched down in front of her daughter. \u201cBut you\u2019re a big girl, right?\u201d Lisa said softly. \u201cYou know Daddy\u2019s sick in his head, he\u2019s scary now. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a vacation with Granny and Pop Pop.\u201d Shannon nodded.\n\nAbsorbing the dynamic between the two of them, Leona categorized and sorted it in her mind, and mirrored Lisa, crouching down beside her. \u201cWhat kind of things do you differently now?\u201d Leona asked the young girl.\n\nShannon shifted back and forth on her feet thoughtfully. \u201cWindows and doors gotta always stay closed and locked. And we need Mommy\u2019s permission to go play in the backyard. If we just go out, the alarm goes off and it\u2019s *loud*,\u201d she said with a grimace and a glance toward the door that led outside, revealing that she had made that particular mistake. \u201cAnd if we ever see Daddy, if we\u2019re out doing stuff or if I\u2019m at school, I gotta tell Mommy, or a teacher.\u201d\n\nLeona nodded slowly. \u201cThis is big girl stuff but sounds like you\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d\n\nShannon smiled proudly.\n\nThe two adults left the kids to their devices and Lisa led the way to the basement, flicking the light switch as she went. \u201cThe kids play down here sometimes, but it\u2019s mostly storage,\u201d she said. \u201cThat couch I mentioned, over there, we use for guests. Just one window over there, to meet fire code standards. It\u2019s covered by the security system, of course.\u201d Leona nodded, following her back up the stairs and then up to the second floor.\n\n\u201cThe bathroom right here is one that we all use, my bedroom\u2019s attached, and the girls are there and there,\u201d Lisa continued.\n\nLeona took a glance out the bathroom window for a bird\u2019s-eye view of the backyard, also noticing the overhang of the roof from the back part of the house. But as was the case with the other windows, they were locked and hooked up to the security system. Lisa showed her through the mildly messy bedrooms of her daughters and then the master, and Leona took in everything she saw, cataloguing it and storing it away.\n\nThey headed back downstairs and stopped in the living room, Lisa letting out a nervous sigh and clasping her hands in front of her. \u201cSo, how does this work? Do you\u2026scout the perimeter regularly and such?\u201d she asked, managing a tight smile at the effort of a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep track of the interior mostly,\u201d Leona told her. \u201cNo use in constantly disarming the security system. And we\u2019ve got those four cameras on the house perimeter, so I\u2019ll check those regularly to make sure they\u2019re still operational, see what\u2019s what. I just need Wi-Fi access. Ari gave me what I need to access the cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Lisa folded her arms. \u201cI do most of my work in the dining room, data entry stuff, pretty boring. Can I get you anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just chill on the couch,\u201d Leona replied. \u201cI\u2019ve got my Sudoku book to kill time. And ideally, tomorrow morning will arrive, we\u2019ll get you on your way, and this will\u2019ve all been a boring waste of time.\u201d\n\nLisa smiled, some tension loosening from her shoulders. \u201cRight. Okay. But still, let me know if you need anything.\u201d\n\nLeona did another thorough sweep of the house, getting a better sense of the security system and the coverage of the cameras outside. She knew Arian had installed them, so they were well-placed with few blind spots. Repetition was the key to getting familiar with the lay of the land wherever you were, so she focused on that.\n\nOnce she was satisfied, she took a Sudoku book from her duffel and spent an hour or so solving puzzles. She set her phone to emit a soft tone every fifteen minutes, prompting her to check each of the camera feeds on her laptop. Eventually she switched to a book of cryptograms.\n\nAt about 6:30, Lisa asked for Leona\u2019s preference on pizza, and she replied that she was partial to pepperoni. They ordered in and Leona met the driver at the door, giving her a quick thanks before shutting the door and resetting the alarm. The family and Leona ate at the kitchen table, the conversation dominated by Shannon\u2019s rapid-fire discussion of things Leona had very little familiarity with. Rose also piped in on occasion and Leona considered whether the child was particularly advanced for her age or if three-year-olds commonly spoke as well as she did.\n\nLeona had no recollection of those younger years, so she had nothing to compare it to, but she assumed that her lack of memories was probably for the best.\n\nThe sounds of impending bedtime echoed through the house at about 8 p.m. and Leona found herself distracted from the puzzle book in her hands. The bond she\u2019d formed with Penelope and Eliza was the closest she\u2019d come to anything she\u2019d ever considered a real family, and she felt, to a certain extent, like she was participating in the recording of a television sitcom. Everything was so normal. But, as she did with the rest of her life among other people, she held steadily to her chosen affable, calm persona through the evening.\n\nEventually, once the girls had been put to bed, Leona and Lisa found themselves in the living room, Lisa on her laptop in the loveseat angled toward the coffee table in front of Leona\u2019s sofa, sitting in silence. \u201cDo you do this sort of work a lot?\u201d Lisa suddenly spoke up, lifting Leona\u2019s gaze from her book. \u201cLike\u2026body-guarding?\u201d\n\n\u201cI work freelance sometimes, yeah,\u201d Leona responded. \u201cMostly I work as a bouncer at a club downtown.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you enjoy it?\u201d\n\nLeona paused. \u201cAh, yeah. Keeps my mind busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas this been really boring, then?\u201d Lisa asked with a grimace.\n\n\u201cNo, just part of the job,\u201d Leona told her with a shake of the head. \u201cThat\u2019s what the books are for. Human minds wander, it\u2019s unavoidable, so the strategy is to manage it. And to a certain extent, you change your brain over time so you experience less of it. There have been plenty of times I really needed to stay aware of everything for hours at a time and that takes more effort.\u201d\n\nLisa nodded slowly and Leona realized the woman probably found the former soldier\u2019s life as interesting as she herself found the odd banality of family life. They lapsed into silence for a while longer, Leona continuing to check the cameras at fifteen-minute intervals, or when her peripheral vision caught one of them light up as the floodlights chased away the darkness. The cameras were decent, but not exactly top of the line, so the occasional brightness helped her determine that the culprit was something nocturnal out hunting for dinner.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Leona\u2019s eyes flicked to the ceiling as she heard a *thump*. But looking to Lisa to gauge her reaction, she just saw resignation. \u201cThat will be Shannon,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened for a couple years, but the past month she\u2019s had\u2026maybe it\u2019s nightmares, maybe it\u2019s a child\u2019s imagination, but she suspects a monster under her bed. The landing you just heard was her jumping away from her bed, lest her ankles be caught.\u201d\n\nLeona listened as the floorboards creaked, revealing that Shannon was making her way down the second-floor hallway and then to the stairs. The military folder in her mind opened, in which she kept her other job divided and organized away from the rest of the world. \u201cDid she describe the monster?\u201d\n\nShaking her head, Lisa put her laptop on the coffee table and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s just a worry, a typical childhood fear.\u201d Leona nodded, flicking through her knowledge like a library\u2019s card catalog, her mind settling on an extremely low probability of this being anything more than a child expressing stress in a way her brain could process. Penelope had discussed this side of her job at length, sorting the dangerous monsters from the imagined as a psychologist, and like her friend, Leona had developed methods of discerning one from the other.\n\nLisa lowered her voice as Shannon\u2019s footsteps were heard coming down the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s never even described anything. Therapist says it\u2019s her mind dealing with having her father as a dangerous figure in her life\u2026 Hey honey,\u201d she spoke up, walking toward the stairs. \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the monster under the bed,\u201d Shannon said earnestly. \u201cIt feels really scary right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really think it\u2019s a monster?\u201d Lisa asked, crouching down in front of her daughter. \u201cOr does it just feel like a monster, like Doctor Gloeckner talked about?\u201d\n\nShannon hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s just scary.\u201d\n\nLeona found a thought building in her mind and she pursed her lips at it contemplatively. \u201cHey, Shannon. You think you\u2019d feel safer with some monster protection?\u201d\n\nShannon eyed her warily. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\nLeona glanced to the girl\u2019s mother, gauging her reaction, and seeing only curiosity. \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have monsters. I\u2019m a security expert, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, right?\u201d Shannon nodded. \u201cBut monsters can\u2019t cross salt lines. The hate salt, all monsters do. So, how about we put one of those in front of your bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we?\u201d Shannon asked, turning to her mother.\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Lisa looked to Leona. \u201cBugs\u2026don\u2019t like salt, do they?\u201d\n\nLeona shook her head as she stood up, sticking a pencil in the page she\u2019d left off on and then putting the book on the coffee table. \u201cAnts, maybe. But it won\u2019t be a problem just for one night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right then\u2026sure. I\u2019ll get the container from the kitchen.\u201d\n\nLeona watched as Shannon visibly relaxed from the incoming backup and Lisa fetched a container of Morton salt, with the familiar logo of a girl with an umbrella front and center. The three of them then went back up to the bedroom and Shannon hung back as Leona opened the flap on the container, pouring a long line from the girl\u2019s bedside table to almost the end of the bed frame.\n\n\u201cOkay. Hop up, see how it feels,\u201d Leona said, closing the flap with a flick of her fingers. She left the container on the girl\u2019s bedside table, in case she decided she wanted to improve her security setup later.\n\nShannon approached the bed, ducking her head down to peek underneath, before lifting herself up onto the mattress. She nodded. \u201cThat helps. I can tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Leona said with a nod. She glanced to Lisa who met her gaze, looking grateful. Leona gave her a tight smile, turning and leaving the room, hearing the mother say, \u201cSweet dreams, honey,\u201d before she left. The two went back down the hallway and down the stairs to the living room.\n\n\u201cThat was ingenious,\u201d Lisa remarked. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn that?\u201d\n\n*Trapping and killing monsters that prey on children like yours.* Leona hesitated. \u201cI was a kid once too,\u201d she finally answered, reclaiming her seat on the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s just the placebo effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s greatly appreciated.\u201d Lisa sighed. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll be able to move on once all this is\u2026over.\u201d Her gaze went distant before she picked up her laptop, resuming whatever she\u2019d been doing. Likewise, Leona resumed her work on the challenging cryptograms in her book.\n\nThe surprise of an imaginary monster under the bed, which Leona found quite a nice break from a real one, was what she\u2019d expected to be the most excitement they had all night. And yet, in the back of her mind, she continued to skim through the file she\u2019d received on Harvey Bowman. The man had slipped off the edge a while ago and, while Lisa had been smart to put her children\u2019s safety first, there was only a certain amount they could do. A formidable opponent like this guy wasn\u2019t deterred easily, Leona knew.\n\nWhen the doorbell rang at about an hour later, Leona was on her feet, her book discarded beside her on the sofa, taking the gun from the holster in the small of her back.\n\n\u201cHe-He wouldn\u2019t-\u201d Lisa took a breath to steady herself and Leona saw blatant fear in her eyes, but also confusion. \u201cHe knows if he comes here, I\u2019ll call the police. He\u2019s not allowed-\u201d\n\n\u201cI got this, just stay calm,\u201d Leona told her. Lisa nodded, but got up from her seat also, taking a few wary steps in the direction of the front door.\n\nLeona motioned for the woman to stay in place as she pulled the living room curtain aside to take a peek out at the street. Her eyes narrowed at the idling sedan at the curb, an illuminated sign on top for Dominos. They\u2019d ordered from them that evening, but there hadn\u2019t been any mistakes in their order that would\u2019ve required another trip. Walking over to the door, Leona looked through the peephole, the porchlight revealing a young man holding a pizza box and a bottle of soda.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t order pizza,\u201d Leona shouted through the door.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026this is 154 Hardgrave, isn\u2019t it? Do you have a kid who might\u2019ve ordered it? I need payment in cash.\u201d\n\nHesitant but knowing she needed to make a choice, Leona unlocked the door and then pressed the buttons to disarm the security system. She got clear of the door\u2019s path before she opened it a foot or so, her gun hidden behind her back. \u201cWhen was the order put in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe usually make it in about half an hour on weekdays,\u201d the man answered. He looked over the receipt again. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Regina Williamson.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lisa exclaimed with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s my neighbor. You must have a typo. She\u2019s 158, next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cGotcha, thanks!\u201d the man said with a grin. \u201cHope I didn\u2019t wake anyone!\u201d he called before heading back the way he\u2019d come.\n\nLeona stared after him, her gaze still wary, her stance still tight. But no one else approached the front door, so she closed it, locked it thoroughly, and reset the alarm. \u201cAll right, hopefully-\u201d She\u2019d turned around to see a man, gun pointed straight at her, having come through the hallway from the den. Lisa noticed and followed her gaze, letting out a shriek and stumbling toward Leona.\n\nLeona gnashed her teeth together, cursing her stupidity. All he\u2019d needed was to pick the lock on the back door, wait for the alarm to be turned off, and make his entrance before it reengaged. An oversight of this magnitude was embarrassing, and she knew immediately she wouldn\u2019t be able to bring herself to charge Ari even for her hourly rate. She\u2019d utterly failed at her job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Leona said calmly.\n\nHarvey Bowman\u2019s face showed nothing but anger and resentment, and he ignored her warning. \u201cPut down the gun. Kick it away.\u201d\n\nLeona took a breath and let it out, irritated, before doing as she was told, though she kept track of where it landed, under the coffee table. She took in his stance, practiced and steady, an easy but firm two-handed grip on his weapon. He had decent trigger discipline at least, his index finger hovering outside the trigger guard. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Leona asked. \u201cMake a run for the border? You\u2019ll never be able to hide these kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding them,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m protecting them.\u201d He gave her a once-over. \u201cYou look former military. You\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s happening to this country. My family is the most important thing to me, and no matter what anyone else does to try to take them away from me, I\u2019m keeping them safe.\u201d\n\nHarvey took one of his hands off the gun, pulling two sets of plastic zip-tie handcuffs from his jacket and tossing them to Leona. \u201cFor both of you. Do her first, then you.\u201d\n\nFury started to churn in Leona\u2019s stomach. There were few things she hated than being made a fool of but letting down two kids that had been counting on her for protection rated right at the top of the list. Her mind flipped through any options she might have, bouncing around any mistakes Harvey could make over the next few minutes. She still had two knives on her and, while using them as weapons was tricky, especially cuffed, she could easily slash a tire of his getaway vehicle when he tried to take off.\n\n\u201cPlease, Harvey, they\u2019re my babies,\u201d Lisa whimpered, tears starting to stream from her eyes as Leona put the cuffs on. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t take them from me. You\u2019re wrong, they\u2019re not in danger, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea,\u201d Harvey scoffed at his ex-wife. He nodded at the second set of cuffs in encouragement, prompting Lisa to put them on Leona. \u201cOver here, now,\u201d he said, motioning with his gun. He gave them a wide berth as they exchanged places, leaving him closer to the front door and them on the threshold of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhat now, Harvey?\u201d Leona asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go get your kids. You really going to hurt the mother of your children?\u201d\n\nHarvey glowered at her. \u201cNo one needs to get hurt.\u201d He took half a step toward the stairwell. \u201cShannon? It\u2019s Daddy! Can you come downstairs?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Leona told him.\n\n\u201cAfter the doorbell, and hearing her mother scream?\u201d he asked, cocking his head at her expectantly. Leona didn\u2019t respond, just listened carefully until they heard soft footsteps making their way down the stairs.\n\nShannon slowly came out from behind the wall that lined the stairwell. \u201cDaddy, just go away,\u201d she said shakily, looking from her father to her mother and Leona as she continued down each step slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping you safe, sweetheart,\u201d he said gently. Leona absently wondered if his tone was fake, if everything about him was fake, or if he really did still care about his daughters. Whether he was trying not to scare her because that was important to him, or because it would be easier to handle them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to a safe place, you and me and your sister. I need you to go get her, okay? I\u2019ve got everything you need. Just make sure Rose has her blankie, of course. And you can choose a teddy bear.\u201d\n\nShannon\u2019s lower lip quivered in fear, but Leona saw a stiffness to her spine, a determination, as she walked closer to him instead of back up the stairs. \u201cYou don\u2019t keep us safe. You scare us. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t live here anymore. Just go away!\u201d\n\nHarvey\u2019s patience faded a bit. \u201cI\u2019m your father, and you\u2019re going to listen to me. Go get. Your sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re my father!\u201d Shannon shouted. \u201cI think you\u2019re a monster! And I know how to get rid of monsters!\u201d At that, her fists, which Leona hadn\u2019t noticed had been clenched the whole time, flung two handfuls of salt directly at her father\u2019s face.\n\nIt took about a quarter of a second for Leona to comprehend what had happened and then another quarter second to evaluate the sudden shift in the situation and to take advantage of it. In the instant that Harvey\u2019s eyes shut and he cried out and flinched at the salt crystals blinding and pain distracting him, Leona lurched forward with two lengthy steps. She leapt into the air as she reached him, grabbing the gun with her handcuffed hands as she went and shoving the barrel upwards in case it went off as she slammed her knee into his chest.\n\nThey flew back from the force and collapsed to the ground hard, with Leona keeping her bent knee stiff and sharp, like doing a corkscrew into the deep end of a pool. She felt something crack under the force when they landed. The additional disorientation and pain Harvey had to deal with gave Leona the opportunity to wrest the gun from the man\u2019s hand and take a few steps back to point it at him, steadily aiming at center mass.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lisa gasped, rushing to her daughter\u2019s side. Leona didn\u2019t move her gaze from the man who was moaning in pain, still just desperately trying to clear his vision. \u201cShannon, are you okay? Jesus Christ.\u201d Out of the corner of her eye, Leona saw the woman embrace her daughter, lifting her handcuffed hands over the child\u2019s head to do so. Leona took that moment to tell Harvey to roll onto his stomach and to interlock his fingers behind his head.\n\n\u201cMy eyes. Oh god, my eyes-\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, get over yourself, shithead,\u201d Leona growled.\n\n\u201cShe said a bad word!\u201d Shannon exclaimed.\n\nLeona smirked faintly as Lisa spoke, \u201cShe did, she absolutely did, but that\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[EU\\] My book Closet Terrors",

According to Pierce, the rings and the high skill levels\u2014granted by the Order of the Twelve Suns\u2019 altar\u2014guaranteed that they\u2019d be invisible to everything short of the Moons. Unfortunately, Dallion no longer believed that.\n\nThe greater the awakened level, the more options existed for bending the rules. In theory, the rings were supposed to prevent him from communicating with anyone within his realm, let alone people half the way across the world. In practice, the combination of companions, music skills, domain ruler abilities, and personal echoes allowed him to bypass the restrictions. His personal echoes knew everything as it happened, as did the guardians of the weapons he held. In turn they could communicate with everyone else within Dallion\u2019s domain network.\n\nIt was in this manner that he had managed to share the events with Euryale, as well as learn what was going on in the outside world. It seemed that the war had heated up again, though not on a front that Dallion needed to be worried about. The Azure federation had gone inland and clashed with a surprisingly capable cadre of imperial soldiers. From what the gorgon had learned, two archdukes had combined their forces, and with the assistance of a few imperial legions had managed to drive the attackers out. The Order of the Seven Moons remained neutral, although sightings of war cleric armies had become more abundant. Mirror Pools all across the empire were discreetly evacuating their members, moving to Sandstorm. Furies were doing the same in ever-increasing numbers. Only the hunters remained hesitant, more often than not choosing to sell their services to archdukes and other provincial nobles.\n\nDallion had made several attempts to get in touch with Dark, but it seemed that the Moons were keeping the dragon out of it. Possibly it was for the better\u2014he wasn\u2019t strong enough to face anything as powerful as this, not to mention there was no telling how he would react upon seeing an unfamiliar dragon.\n\nA hundred feet away, on the other side of the tunnel, Pierce waved his hand in an attempt to attract Dallion\u2019s attention. Getting the hint, Dallion waved back.\n\n*Stay there.* Pierce\u2019s lips moved without making a sound. *I found one ahead.*\n\nDallion nodded. The realm structure he was in didn\u2019t have any obvious way forward. There were several openings leading further away from the giant corridor, as well as one leading up.\n\n*I\u2019ll go up to check.* Dallion shaped the answer with his lips.\n\nCombining athletics and acrobatics, he rushed up faster than a wall gecko. The passage curved and split, but eventually it led to a section above the cluster of realm structures. From there, Dallion was able to get a better view of the chamber that lay beyond.\n\nSurely enough, there was a dragonlet there. The better news was that the creature wasn\u2019t aware of their presence.\n\n*Time to close the net,* Dallion said to himself.\n\nFive days ago, after Abla had earned his dragon slayer achievement, the group had split, making their way to the realm\u2019s center. Everyone was free to proceed as they wished, following two basic rules: be stealthy and always remain in sight of at least one other member of the group. That way whoever found the dragon nest first would let everyone else know. Now it had finally happened.\n\nDallion quickly made his way back down. It was tempting to use magic, but he didn\u2019t want to risk scaring off the dragonlet. Sprinting through the massive tunnel, he then rushed to where Pierce was.\n\n\u201cI think this is it,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s younger than anything we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nAge wasn\u2019t a factor, but odds were good that the nest itself wasn\u2019t far off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell the rest to gather,\u201d the mage whispered back.\n\n\u201cJust tell them we found a dragon,\u201d Dallion quickly said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what it does first.\u201d\n\nIt took half a minute for Pierce to convey the message to the next member of the hunting party, after which, he and Dallion closed in on the dragonlet. From a distance, the creature was the epitome of innocence. Curious about its surroundings, it would waddle about, looking at every strangely shaped piece of rock with so much fascination as if it were an undiscovered treasure. For over an hour it went back and forth with no plan or pattern until suddenly a change was forced on it.\n\nHidden within the honeycomb of structures, Dallion heard the distant sound of flapping wings. Immediately, he raised a finger, telling Pierce to remain cautious.\n\nThe sound of wings grew progressively, until the expected happened\u2014a large amber dragon became visible near the realm\u2019s ceiling, making its way towards the dragonlet. A basic layer of illusion surrounded it, although not as thorough as the one the group had fought upon entering the realm had. Its size was truly impressive.\n\n\u201cThink that\u2019s her?\u201d Pierce whispered.\n\n\u201cNo, just another adult,\u201d Dallion replied, using the spell Adzorg had taught him to partially glimpse through the illusion. \u201cJust an adult.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s more of them\u2026\u201d\n\nUpon reaching the dragonlet, the dragon didn\u2019t even slow down. Sending out an air current, it grabbed the very confused infant, then turned around, flying back to where it came from. This was what Dallion was waiting for. Combining athletic, acrobatic, art, and music skills, he leaped after the creature. Pierce followed immediately after.\n\nFaster than a lightning bolt, the two leaped from spot to spot, always keeping an obstacle between them and the adult dragon. Behind them, other members of the party followed as the net was slowly pulled in a specific direction.\n\nThe dragon didn\u2019t seem to be overly cautious, more occupied in keeping the fidgeting dragonlet in the air. The closer it got to the center heart of the realm, the more the open spaces grew. The clusters of structures moved further and further away, becoming smaller and smaller until at one point they stopped altogether.\n\nNot wanting to risk getting seen, Dallion stopped. An opening the size of a huge valley extended ahead. More spherical than flat, the empty space stretched in all directions, only interrupted by a mountain structure in the middle.\n\n*The nest.* Dallion thought.\n\nSlightly dome-shaped, it stretched all the way up to the ceiling, covered in ragged cliffs and hundreds of cave openings. In many ways, it was closer to a hive than a nest, sticking out like a sore thumb. The dragon had clearly added it later, proclaiming the realm as its own. It made an all-out charge all the more difficult: there was no obvious way to get to the mountain unnoticed, not to mention that if the dragon had domain ruler abilities the mountain itself was a lethal weapon.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the others here,\u201d Dallion said.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit close?\u201d Pierce glanced back at the way they had arrived from.\n\n\u201cFor a dragon like that, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Either it knows we\u2019re here or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNot the best line of reasoning, but Pierce went with it.\n\nBit by bit, the rest of the group arrived.\n\nThe Count was the fifth to show up, his expression conveying his disapproval of the location better than any words could. Abla arrived a few minutes later along with a third of the overall group. Tors, naturally, was among them. Looking at his cousin, Dallion could almost feel pity. The Elazni remained pale, as if he\u2019d been through a week of heavy drinking and intense flu.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d Abla asked.\n\n\u201cNothing good,\u201d The Count replied before anyone else had a chance to. \u201cToo open for us to hide, too far for us to sprint. A spell will stir the entire nest, sending anything with wings against us, and that\u2019s before we come to face the big one. We can only guess what its skills are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr that of its mate,\u201d Dallion added, more out of spite towards the Count than anything else.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d The Count gave him a warning glance. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing if we\u2019ll be facing one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can bring it here,\u201d Astra suggested. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make a sneak, just make it believe we\u2019re making one.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Astra?\u201d Tors snorted. A quick gesture from Abla made him quickly shut up.\n\n\u201cA small group charges head on to flush the smaller creatures out,\u201d the woman continued. \u201cPierce and Dal could use a few large spells, since there\u2019s no point in hiding anymore. If the big one hasn\u2019t come out by them, that\u2019ll make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the main group pulls back to a fortified position,\u201d Abla finished for her. \u201cThe problem is, what here could be considered a fortified position? The rings make us invisible, but the dragon remains the domain ruler.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not. The rectangles showed us that the domain was broken. That doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no guardian, but it doesn\u2019t mean there is one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible.\u201d the Count nodded. \u201cIt\u2019ll still have the advantage, though. Even if it doesn\u2019t use domain tricks, it can scorch through anything here.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless we don\u2019t fight here,\u201d Dallion added.\n\nThe suggestion seemed pretty out of the box even for him, for everyone\u2014even the Count\u2014turned towards him, expectantly.\n\n\u201cWe shatter the realm,\u201d Dallion said, his heart tightening at the suggestion. \u201cThat will spit everyone into the real world and\u2026\u201d He paused to take a deep breath. Even when it came to guardian-less domains, the notion of deliberately destroying it from within made him uneasy. \u201cAnd collapse the ruins on top of the dragons,\u201d he finished. \u201cWe were on the outside when we entered the realm, so we won\u2019t have to worry about falling debris. Not to the extent they would.\u201d\n\nA smile curved on the Count\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThen we finish off what we started in the open,\u201d he said. \u201cWon\u2019t be easy, but we\u2019d have negated its greatest advantages. The sealed will be at risk, but they\u2019re done for, anyway. I think we should go for it.\u201d He turned to Abla. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll have a better chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt still won\u2019t work!\u201d Tors said, almost in panic. \u201cThere\u2019s at least one domain ruler. We felt the bubble in the real world. We\u2019re just changing one terrain for another.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you prefer to fight here?\u201d Astra shook her head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying that charging head on might be better. At least then we have the element of surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not do both?\u201d Pierce joined in after a long period of silence. \u201cIf we fight here, we\u2019re at an obvious disadvantage. If we try to break the realm, we give the dragon the chance to prepare. What if we break the realm while also breaking the nest? That way, the dragon will think that we\u2019re targeting it here, and in a way we will be. However, our goal will also be to shatter what\u2019s behind the mountain as well.\u201d\n\nThe plan sounded crazy enough to actually work. In his mind, Dallion could picture it. A large enough magic attack combined with hundreds of line and point attacks would create the impression that they were trying to kill the dragon within its realm. He\u2019d have to sacrifice all his ray of destruction cylinders, and use several echoes, but it might just be doable.\n\n\u201cHow many echoes can you make?\u201d Dallion asked Pierce.\n\n\u201cA bit more than a dozen. After that, their magic won\u2019t be worth much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can work. The only question is who\u2019ll lead the fake charge? I doubt sending an echo would work, so anyone who goes will be in more danger than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d Abla crossed his arms. \u201cI will. Pierce, can you find some time to cast a few magic barriers during everything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d The mage nodded. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be a problem. Against a great dragon, they\u2019ll be worth crap, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to stop any attack, just look flashy. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d",

        "selftext": "**SPOILERS FOR DD2 IN THIS POST!!!**\n\n**PROCEED WITH CAUTION ARISEN!!!**\n\n**SKIP THIS WHOLE THREAD UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE!!!**\n\n**Preface:**\n\nI've played Dragons Dogma 1 on PS3, hated it at first, then eventually it became one of my favorite games of all time. Especially when Dark Arisen came out on PC, it got even higher on my list. Never played Dragons Dogma: Online because I was too lazy to set it up. When this game got revealed, I damn near gave myself a heart attack. I never thought we'd see a sequel.\n\nI spent all nighters on DD2 the moment it came out. I love this game a lot, but I just wanted to get some thoughts down after beating the game with 40+ hours.\n\n**Let's get this out of the way:**\n\n\\- The Microtransactions suck. Useless as fuck. No need to buy them at all. I was able to complete the game no problem without them. Sucks they're there, but oh well.\n\n\\- Performance is ass. Even my rig struggled in city areas. Some areas ran fine, but areas like forests did experience some drop in frames. They need to fix this as soon as possible because I know there are people who can barely run the game which really sucks.\n\n\\- One Save File was also a thing in DD1, but we can't even make a new game in DD2... That's really fucking stupid. I want to do another playthrough as a mage, but want a fresh playthrough. Not NG+. NG+ would be boring anyway since not much changes.\n\nNow to the main points.\n\n**Story and Side Quests:**\n\nI'll be honest, the Story in these games were never groundbreaking. I appreciate the tone and lore of the world itself. The cyclical nature of the world and how the Arisen and the Dragon plays a huge factor in the outcome of the world is really cool, but everything else around it is pretty meh.\n\nI think I prefer DD1's story overall. DD1 had a slow beginning, but slowly amped up when you got closer to meeting the Dragon for the \"final\" battle. The cutscenes and leadup to the Grigori fight is some of the most memorable moments in that game. The dialogue, the music, and helplessness you feel against Grigori felt epic. Don't even get me started on the impact of Post-Game. I even enjoy the theory that the Duke was sending the Arisen on missions to get him killed and stray them away from defeating the Dragon. It adds flavor to a story that is pretty basic. Side quests were okay. Some were straight up boring, but others I didn't mind. Especially if there was good combat along the way. I can name some characters, but I'd be lying bastard if I said these characters were deep. NPC's, even story important NPC's, are pretty shallow most of the time. Meme worthy yes, but not deep. You won't get Baldur's Gate 3 level characters, but I'm fine with that. The gameplay and memorable story moments like the Dragon Scenes and Post-Game carry the experience for me. Even if the real final boss sucks, the music and story impact makes the whole thing worth it. Of course there's also Dark Arisen with the Bitterblack Isle story, which I thought was cool and a nice buildup to Daimon. The atmosphere is what carried BBI in my opinion.\n\nDD2 starts off interesting. I like starting in prison and making our way to Vermund where we try to uncover our purpose. On top of that, we have to expose the fake Arisen and figure out how he's commanding pawns. I was intrigued, but the moment we go to Battahl, I slowly started giving less of a shit. We reforge the godsway with help from the Founder King of Vermund, Dragonforge and Ambrosius and then it's off to chase Phalous. We chase him, fight the Talos statue, and then it's off to the final battle. The Dragon is summoned, holds your beloved hostage (TBH, your beloved matters much less in this game) and forces you to choose. I'm glad they still have the option to leave your beloved to become a king too. If you choose to fight, we're monologed all the way to the final arena and fight to the death. The post game in the unmoored world is really cool initially, but just like post game in DD1, it leaves a lot to be desired. You gather as many allies you can to the safe haven, fight the unique dragons across the land until you reach the final battle. PSYCH, it's not even a final battle. You get this Gargantuan Mutated Dragon and think, oh snap this is going to be the greatest fight in the game, just for it to end in a cutscene... The End. That was really disappointing. I liked the changes of the unmoored world, but it still has that problem from DD1 where it doesn't feel like it's been fully developed. I kept having this lingering feeling of, \"That's it?\". Side quests were on the same level as DD1 for me. Not crazy, but if it led to good rewards or a good fight, I didn't mind.\n\nDD1 had more interesting story beats in my opinion. The hydra fight, doing Wyrm hunts and fighting the Griffin in Bluemoon tower, the Cockatrice fight, the whole final battle with Grigori, there were more memorable moments. It wasn't perfect, but it at least had more memorable story moments than DD2.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nDD2 easily takes the cake. This is what carried the whole experience for me. Complaints people have about fast travel and such never bothered me. It makes traveling tense and forces you to prepare before setting off to fight dangerous monsters. Plus, Now that I know the game, I can place port crystals in the correct spots for future playthroughs. The camping and loss gauge never bothered me and I thought they were great additions to the game. The physics with players and monsters is so much fun. Getting smacked off a bridge by a cyclops and ragdolling into a ravine never gets old. Mystic Spear getting a skill to pick up objects and hurl them towards monsters is also a really fun time. Gameplay feels just like what I wanted. More of the same, but expanded upon.\n\n**-- WORLD:**\n\nThe world feels much more grand and alive in DD2. We get different biomes and habitats for monsters to roam around. Seeing a Griffin fly in the air and come down to fight me 1 hour later is exhilarating. Seeing monsters fighting each other is always a blast. Both games are fun to explore, but I love DD2's range of exploration. So many structures like bridges to interact with, hidden paths, shortcuts, hidden treasures, and ways to maneuver around the whole world. I had a blast exploring DD2's world. Even the post game felt better in terms of the world than DD1. The water is completely drained which changed a lot of the environment. I wish there was more monster variety in post-game like in DD1, but everything else is fantastic. DD1 had a fine world, but DD2 trumphs over a lot of that first games aspects. Unfortunately, there is nothing as good as BBI in DD2.\n\nNPC's are pretty much the same from what I could see. Nothing deep. You can talk, gift, buy stuff, and that's it. I'm glad they still have a schedule and will go off to do their own thing. Makes the world feel a bit more alive. Pawns exploring the world is also fun since you can come across pawns from earlier in the journey. I remember finding a Lv 20 Kratos who was a Thief around 15 hours. 15 hours later I found the same Kratos wandering Battalh. Little things like that I love.\n\nOne thing I did wish is that Armor and Weapons felt more special. Just like the first game, you can literally buy the best stuff and you'll be good. I wish there were more unique pieces of armor or weapons that you could acquire if you did certain quests or found really hidden treasure.\n\n**-- VOCATIONS:**\n\nAlthough I know there were vocations that weren't included from DDO like Alchemist, I feel like the ones we were given are good enough.\n\n\\- Fighter is great as usual, but the transition to Warrior feels MUCH better compared to DD1. Thank god because Warrior needed the buff. You really feel like a badass with a 2 Hander. Fighter is still a good time though. You can hold your own and it doesn't feel as boring as DD1.\n\n\\- Archer feels fine, but does feel weird without daggers. They can hold their own, but not as much compared to other classes. They do feel more like a support class to be honest.\n\n\\- Thief felt just like old school strider without the bow. Skullsplitter your way to victory. Still fun to play and one of my favorites.\n\n\\- Mystic Spear was AWESOME! The variety of abilities in combat felt great! So far it's my favorite class and what I completed the game with.\n\n\\- Wayfarer could potentially be the most broken class of all. I haven't experimented much with it yet, but I can't wait to have a Mystic Spear and Magic Bow at the same time in a playthrough. Or even Staff with Daggers. You can even recreate assassin with Sword/Daggars + Bow.\n\n\\- I have not played Mage, Sorcerer, Magic Archer, and Trickster. I have no opinion yet, but from what I've heard, Sorcerer players from DD1 have been disappointed which doesn't sound promising. It doesn't sound like you can be as OP as Sorcerers are in DD1. Trickster sounds alright and I haven't heard anything about Magic Archer yet.\n\nI'm surprised we didn't get a Ranger class from DD1 or any more hybrid classes like Thief/Mage, Archer/Thief, Archer/Fighter. That's probably what Wayfarer is for. I'm fine with it. The vocations we have now feels enough for me personally. No need to bloat out Vocations that people may or may not use. Every vocation feels like they're viable class which is what I wanted since DD1.\n\n**--PAWNS:**\n\nThe pawn system seems to be a little better too. I like the banter between your squad as we explore, even if it gets grating hearing the same dialogue over and over. \"THERE'S A LADDER OVER THERE! THERE'S A LADDER OVER THERE! THERE'S A LADDER OVER THERE! THERE'S A LADDER OVER THERE!\" I love getting pointed to a treasure chest or cave that I missed along the way and the comradery of beating a big monster and giving your pawn a high five is a nice touch. The AI feels less stupid compared to DD1. I hated playing Sorcerer in DD1 because my pawns would run towards me for no reason and bring a chimera over to my direction like dumbasses even while issuing commands. When I issue a command in DD2, they actually seem to follow it much better. The mechanics of your pawn learning from another world is still there and I love this system. It definitely comes in handy for finding weaknesses if you're a mage sort of character, but also helps when pawns start attacking weak points more often due to the knowledge they've gained.\n\n**--MONSTERS:**\n\nThe monsters in DD2 is just as comparable to DD1's monsters with a couple new Big creatures like the Sphinx and Minotaurs. DD2 features more variety with monster variants, but I still wish we had more variety in general. Fighting Saurian Variation #7 did get old after a while.\n\nWhere are the Hydras? Cockatrice? Evil Eyes? With the amount of Small and Large Monsters that exist in DDO, I'm surprised that only like 1 monster made it into DD2. Pretty disappointing, but I guess the roster we have now is good enough.\n\nNow if we compare it to DD:DA, DD2 doesn't compare. There's enough monsters in DA that make the whole experience worth it. Death, Elemental Wyverns, Living Armor, Lich + Dragon, Giant Beholder Eye, Daimon, Giant GoreCyclops, and much more. Some of these monsters are sorely missed.\n\nEven though what we have right now is good enough, I wish we still had more monsters to fight. Hopefully an expansion can give us more monsters for the roster.\n\n**--POSTGAME:**\n\nI love the look of postgame. Just like the first game, the game becomes the apocalypse. This time in DD2, you have a time limit of 1 weeks worth of rests and drained water. I miss the everfall, but the red apocalypse is still pretty cool. Still wish there was more monster variety in Postgame, but oh well. Maybe in a future expansion. Story wise I wish it was better too. Evacuating cities was fine, but then it just ends. Really disappointing.\n\n**Music:**\n\nDD2 does not compare to DD1 or DA in terms of music. It's not even close. The first game has such beautiful pieces of music that will stick with me forever. Eternal Return, Cassidiris Theme, Overworld Theme, Destructive To All, Character Creator Music, and IMMINENT TRIUMPH! Dark Arisen had more with the BBI theme, Coils of Light (English and Japanense), and Daemon's Second Theme. Into Free is also a Certified Hood Classic. The music is so amazing that it helps carry the experience in DD1 and DA.\n\nDD2's music was fine. Imminent triumph is still there, but doesn't feel as epic as DD1 or grand as DDO. There were some good sounding pieces in the dragon fight and other monster battles, but nothing hits as hard as the first game. Music is subjective of course so make of that what you will. DD1 + DA have amazing pieces of music that I wish made it to this game. It would have been a miracle to hear new music in DD2 that would have been just as good.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nIs DD2 better than DD1?\n\nYes!\n\nIs DD2 better than DD:DA?\n\nYes in Gameplay, but Overall, I think I still prefer Dark Arisen. There's so much charm in that game that has kept me coming back for years. The Fights, the Music, BBI in General, and certain story moments keep that game in my favorites of all time. These games are almost Neck and Neck with each other to me with DA edging higher.\n\n**What does DD2 need?**\n\n1. Fix the performance issues and lack of a new game option bullshit. Microtransactions can stay. I don't care cause I'll never buy that garbage.\n2. ~~First off, whoever can make a mod that replaces the music in this game with music from DD:DA, this would solve my music complaint instantly.~~ EDIT: There is DLC for $3 that replaces the Music with DD1's music! Still missing DA, but for now this is fine as a workaround until I get that mod to add DA music as well and Into Free.\n3. More monsters! I know the developers have more monster concepts that they would want to implement. More small and large monsters would be awesome. We need stuff comparable to BBI. Or maybe even make the Post-game more interesting with new monsters like how the Everfall in DD1 had fights with the Hydra, Evil Eye, and Ur-dragon.\n4. Dungeons or areas comparable to BBI.\n5. More Unique Armors and Weapons.\n6. DDO Vocations would be a nice plus.\n7. Better post-game content. Give me an actual final boss with more monsters! Final fight on the Moon? Or even let me fight that juiced up Dragon!\n8. Doubt they'll fix the story ever, but more interactions with NPC's and your pawns would be nice.\n\nThank you for coming to my rambling TED Talk. I still love this game and think it was worth the wait, but there are things I know they can do to improve the experience. There will probably be an expansion like 3 years later, so here's hoping it's comparable to DA.\n\nWhat do you guys think of the game so far? Even if you haven't beaten it yet, I'd love to hear thoughts.",

And so long as there's no malicious intent, there's no issues. \n\n\n\nSide B would say that there's no such thing as personal private use, because it will get out sooner or later often via third parties who happened to get their hands on the material. \n\n  \nMore explanation, centering on Side B, so people don't get bored. \n\n\n\nHistorically speaking, private stuff has a bad habit of ending up online. Hunter Biden's laptop is a pretty famous example off the top of my head for how stuff on your private laptop could end up online. There are forums online where people would post pornographic material found on the laptops they receive for repair. How many pornographic material owners keep their material password protected with a system self destruct mechanism to protect the material from authorized access? There's also data breaches that can happen, as shown by the Fappening 1 and 2. And this is just talking about the action in general. I havent even started on talking about consent and informed consent, and given that the likely scenario considered by OP would be doing deepfakes of your gf or wife, then we'd be having all sorts of trust issues if the photos were used without the knowledge of the person. The damage of such content being released on the internet can be catastrophic to a person's life, both professionally and personally. And due to that I do not think anything less than the informed consent of the affected party on the creation of the material is acceptable. \n\n\n\nI will also point readers towards reporting done by The Feed on an international forum shut down in 2018 by FBI and Dutch authorities which uploaded thousands of deepfake nudes of women using photos posted on their private social media account. Even if those pictures remained \"private\", the discovery of these photos by the victims has led to significant mental trauma and damage, and I would go as far as to say that they'll be having trust issues whenever they have their photos taken and/or posted online. So yeah, the mere existence and knowledge of existence of these photos can be that damaging. And we can even infer that people might be a lot more violent and confrontational when photographs of them are taken in public, despite the act being considered as included in freedom of speech laws. \n\n  \nRealistically speaking tho (deviating from the question discussing morality), I dont think all of this is gonna be worth anything in 5-10 years. Because sooner or later, deepfake porn is gonna be the norm, and even if nations ban them, there will be nations out there who will tolerate the content, and allow hosting of said content.",

        "selftext": " So a few days ago I wrote a paragraph about why I don\u2019t like BSD characters and while some people chose to be ignorant and grill me, some others heard me out and I had discussions with them. Thanks to those people, I decided to re-write my rant and clear some stuff up. Thank you to those who actually engaged in conversations with me as I have definitely learned some more things. It's always good to hear other people's opinions. \n\nBefore my first complaint, I would like to clarify that I love this show and have been watching for a long time! I will continue watching and hope for the shows best, I just wanted to strike up a conversation and maybe shed some light on a topic that's not exactly praising the show \u00b4\uff65\u1d17\uff65`\n\nMy first complaint is **pacing**. I don\u2019t think the show has good pacing at all, with most of the emotional scenes being too random and unnecessary and just not making me feel anything for the characters. There needs to be some \u2018filler\u2019 episodes where everything slows down so the characters can be explored. How long can a show be plot based until it's boring? The main attraction of shows are characters and how they\u2019re all different, how some are likable, how some are feared, how some are sympathetic(at least in my opinion). I don\u2019t think BSD has many different characters, with most of them only existing to serve the plot. When it comes to the excuse of \u2018read the light novels\u2019, it's complete bullshit in my opinion. I should not have to read 10 books to understand characters in the first place. But, I did read all of the light novels and I will say that from what I\u2019ve learned, they\u2019re literally just the sob stories of characters. Whatever depth they have in the light novels are not carried on to the main manga unfortunately. \n\nMy second complaint: I think BSD is too plot-based for its own good. \n\nFirst of all I would like to clarify that there is **nothing wrong** with a show being plot based, but I think that even if the plot is important, the characters should still be well written, and I don\u2019t think BSD characters are.\n\nHere are the main problems with BSD being too fast paced and not having proper pacing: \n\n**Too many characters:** Most characters solely exist to serve the plot and have mildly entertaining personalities to make up for their lack of depth. Too many characters is a big problem because you constantly lose focus of who is doing what and who is actually important. Most characters keep being forgotten about and then being randomly brought back to serve the plot which is very frustrating and a reminder of how lazy the writing is. I can\u2019t care about any of these characters if all they are is their abilities.\n\n**Implications of character depth:** BSD does a good job of showing and not telling in most cases. In fact, *it does too good of a job*. Most information known is either from 10 other books or from *implication. Implication* is a good tactic until it's not. BSD has finished season 5, yet lots of information is still unknown. At this point, there needs to be more than just implications! Most things known about the characters are still theories and it frustrates me. Asagiri is not smart for this, he\u2019s just either withholding important information for some reason or just can\u2019t write actual characters. A way this was done well is with Yosano. Her backstory was not revealed until way later and this was a good choice, but this still doesn\u2019t make Yosano interesting as she still gets sidelined and not explored. She has immense trauma but her trauma doesn\u2019t seem to affect the way she lives or acts or talks at all, she's mostly just used as her ability to heal people.\n\n**A characters needs and wants (something BSD lacks):** A character has needs and wants, with the wants driving the plot and needs driving the emotional aspect of a story. A character **wants** something, so they **do** something which is what the plot is. A want is a character's *external* struggle. For BSD, one of the wants is defeating Fyodor, and so that is the plot. However, if that's all, a story is boring because technically nothing happens other than characters succeeding and the show ending. So, while the characters are on their desired journey, there is an obstacle, and the obstacle can only be defeated by the **need** of a character. The **need** of a character is their *internal* struggle, something they need to change about *themselves* so they can overcome the obstacle of the plot and deliver a message that makes the show memorable. **Wants** are basically the flashy fight scenes and **needs** are the emotional scenes that make you sympathize with a character. *BSD doesn\u2019t have the needs of characters*. Or at least, the needs of the characters are not explored. BSD only has or only focuses on the **wants** of characters, which is the plot. BSD is a fast paced show with multiple plots and Asigiri cannot find a balance between plot and character. Character flaws and relationships are not explored which leaves no room for any growth or development to happen. It's just a bunch of people with powers fighting. This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that season 5 is over and the characters are still mostly the same with minor changes in their behaviours that do not matter. The plot does not affect the characters at all, they all just fight and fight with some fake emotional dialogue until everything goes back to normal. There are no important changes to characters and it's just frustrating to see because there is lots of potential for most of the cast to grow as characters. I\u2019m not gonna dive deep into the characters one by one, but I will say that the main characters still fall flat with most of them having one thing in common: A tragic backstory, known also as a sob story. \n\n**Tragic backstory:** A sob story is a cheap and lazy way done for the audience to easily sympathize with a character. When every single character is crying because of something that happened in their past, it gets a bit too boring and predictable. I can\u2019t care about these characters if all they do is whine about having a sad past. To make a character realistic, they need to live with the aftermath of their past and learn to grow (P.S: development doesn\u2019t always need to be good, they can always turn evil or something as well, so I'm not saying that all of the characters should become better people). A backstory should **influence** a character's life and motivations, not just exist so they can cry. \n\nThats all for now I'm tired  \ud83e\udd72 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone would like to disagree or add anything please do! I love talking with people  \uff61\\^\u203f\\^\uff61",

I also find it odd that Chuuya and Atsushi still haven't met lol. Idk the ADA doesn't feel much like a found family to me when most don't even interact with each other all that much other then when the plot needs them to interact. It would've been sweet to have them just talk as friends/family as a fluff episode where we could have more insight to the dynamic the ADA has with each other.",

One of the major themes of BSD is 'stray dogs' who don't feel like they deserve to live finding a reason to keep on living and we see this in, for example, Kyouka. We meet Kyouka, find out about her tragic backstory and then watch as she comes to terms with the truth about Demon Snow and works out what living and being a good person means to her. Even Akutagawa >!acknowledges that Kyouka's mindset has changed when he meets her during the Cannabalism arc.!<\n\nI don't agree that the characters are constantly crying about their pasts though. Yosano, for example, is not constantly crying about her past. Are you thinking of Atsushi? Because I think it completely makes sense for him to be a 'crybaby' (although I don't think he is one). He's been abused for what, at least 10 years depending on when he entered the orphanage. The passage of time in BSD isn't clear, but it seems more like months have passed since Vol. 1 rather than years, so I think it's unrealistic for Atsushi to overcome 10+ years of abuse in a matter of months, but he's definitely getting to a point where the trauma is no longer crippling him as a fear motivation. Following on from this, you say that it's just battle upon battle with no development, but I disagree. There are some really great meta-analyses on Tumblr that highlight, for example, how Atsushi and Akutagawa have grown and come to terms with certain aspects of their personality and pasts through battling against and then alongside each other.\n\nI do agree that I wish we could see more of certain characters. I am completely biased of course, but off the top of my head I wish we could see more of Kunikida, Kenji, Yosano, Natsume-sensei, Steinbeck vs Fitzgerald, etc. In any story it's impossible to develop every single character and for every single battle to have some kind of character development. However, it sounds like we've got at least two more arcs >!(Order of the Clock Tower and potentially an arc with Chinese authors?)!< and if they're as long as the DoA arc I'm sure we'll have more development to come :)",

I fully agree about Atsushi and I LOVE a protagonist who cries, I don't have any problems with Atsushi crying or having flashbacks of his past as thats a part of his identity and I think that its mostly well done (it was better in the manga though) I just wish there wasn't SO many sad backstories in the show.\n\nI do think there is development in the show, I just think that its not shown in the right way? Most development is shown with fights, like >!Akutugawa saving Atsushi and turning into a vampire !<was a nice moment and highlighted how much they've grown together, but I just wish we had more scenes of them actually interacting and not just fighting so the audience can make the connection of their growth as well without *just* fights. I think I want more toned down 'mature' scenes that have meaningful dialogue you know? \n\n  \nI fully agree that more characters should be explored and I hope that the next arcs are going to be better!

What is its source?\" \n2) Portion of the rules and scope of the Book (there is an inconsistency). But we still don't know the energy source of the Book.\n3) Any phenomena caused by ability, namely singularity and skill-derived life form\nAnd the majority of the information is locked in novels Stormbringer (mainly) and 55 Minutes, except regarding the Book. \n\nAbout the tragic backstory, maybe because the majority of events in BungoSD are related and/or impact of the Great War. War is something tragic after all. Showing how corrupted humans could be. That's why the main antagonist in BungoSD universe is actually corrupted people in the government like shown in 55 Minutes and Stormbringer as well as Fukuchi's motive. Also, i want to put an exception for Stormbringer (mainly) and 55 Minutes as these two novels give clue/hints and or probable motive(s) for the involvement of European parties in future arc(s), important for the plot progression. So, not only sobbing back stories of character(s). That's why whenever I write theories either regarding probable plot or mechanism of abilities and any skill phenomenon (example that entity at the end of season 5), I always use those two novels as main source, mainly Stormbringer. \n\nNext, it is understandable why BungoSD has a lot of characters tho. BSD's scope is huge. It involves not only characters in Yokohama (Japan) but also other countries in Europe and America, multi-national. Afterall, the beginning of the majority of issues in BSD is the conflicts in Europe. The issue now is how Asagiri maximizes those characters. Sadly, it is near impossible to dive into each character if we depend on the main story (manga-anime) only. Therefore, novels are the solution. And with the time limit and Asagiri is a human, it is understandable Asagiri could only give information to explore several \"*crucial*\" characters that are really important for the plot progression. So, in conclusion I only dislike the way he drags in revealing crucial basic information like what is ability? what is the book? and what is the motive of Great War? Maybe he likes it to stay as a mystery (lol).",

We get to see how his past affected him, his struggles, how he had difficulties accepting himself as a human, about his relationship with Dazai, Sheep, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Kouyou, the Flags and Adam and how Port Mafia ultimately became his family. We get to know why he's so strong, why he's loyal to Mori,why he acts the way he does, and about his past. It wasnt 1 chapter of backstory like most characters get, but 200 pages focused on him, making the fans get attatched to him.\n\nNow this is definitely not exceptional. There're a lot of anime i've seen that've done it better. HxH, Gintama, AoT, Fmab are some great examples. But, compared to the rest of the cast, its *miles* better. In my pretty useless opinion Dazai and Chuuya are the only characters who have good character depth and who'd i'd feel sad for if they died (lol its bsd no one dies tho)\n\nAlso, i agree the pacing in bsd is absolutely awful, there's mostly back to back mindgames and action (much like JJK in that regard) and Asagiri definitely could have handled it better cuz the concept of the anime is wonderful. Plus, i love how you pointed out how a tragic backstory doesnt necessarily make for a good backstory. I too hate it when the author just gives the character a sad past and is like 'yeah now they'll probably feel sad if they died' (and lol they never even do). See, ok, Asagiri isnt killing characters. Thats fine. But when he keeps them alive, then he should develop them properly at least, no? \n\nI love this post, tysm, its great to see people do actually think the way i do :)",

There have been very few instances of me going \"I don't care what happens to character X\", in fact maybe zero instances. Powers and great visual design help a lot here, but it's still first and foremost the writing.\u00a0\n\n\nBut after we get interested and invested... It doesn't go anywhere. We have a few characters that have actual storylines and development (for example, Atsushi, Rampo, Aya&Stoker), a few who's development *sorta exists* but moves at a snails' pace (Lucy, Fitzgerald, Kunikida, maaaaybe Gogol) and then there's 70% of the cast that just exists.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich, in theory, is okay - for a big show, it's okay to have simple background/villain of the week characters - *except most of BSD cast isn't introduced as background*.

I know what to expect from all the characters and it just doesn't effect me like it used to\n\n  \nI think I over exaggerated a bit when it comes to the characters crying, I meant it more in a 'the backstory is constantly reminded to the audience so we can feel bad for the character' way. I fully agree about Atsushi and I LOVE a protagonist who cries, I don't have any problems with Atsushi crying or having flashbacks of his past as thats a part of his identity and I think that its mostly well done (it was better in the manga though) I just wish there wasn't SO many sad backstories in the show.\n\nI do think there is development in the show, I just think that its not shown in the right way? Most development is shown with fights, like >!Akutugawa saving Atsushi and turning into a vampire !<was a nice moment and highlighted how much they've grown together, but I just wish we had more scenes of them actually interacting and not just fighting so the audience can make the connection of their growth as well without *just* fights. I think I want more toned down 'mature' scenes that have meaningful dialogue you know? \n\n  \nI fully agree that more characters should be explored and I hope that the next arcs are going to be better! They sound super interesting :D",

I also find it odd that Chuuya and Atsushi still haven't met lol. Idk the ADA doesn't feel much like a found family to me when most don't even interact with each other all that much other then when the plot needs them to interact. It would've been sweet to have them just talk as friends/family as a fluff episode where we could have more insight to the dynamic the ADA has with each other.",

        "selftext": "It's one of those late Spring days where the weather is lovely and the indications for summer are all there: the skies are blue, the air is fresh, and it's warm and clear. I sit at a table outside Le Caff with some new friends I met recently. There are four t-girls; two are cross-dressers like me, Sophie and Rachel, both of whom are sexy girls, although Sophie is the sexier, and neither is as sexy as little old me, even if I do say so myself! There is a woman called Amelie, who is what used to be called trans-sexual although people say you shouldn't use that term nowadays. Apparently she is very well hung and I wonder how she hides it under her bias cut skirt. There is also a feminine person called Autumn who wears women's jeans, boots, and tops, has shoulder length black hair and a pretty feminine face but doesn't wear the fake boobs or skirts like the three of us cross-dressers do.\n\nMyself, Sophie, and Rachel are all in short skirts, black stockings, and black heels, and all have great legs, but in my opinion I would win in a leg-off! I mean, Sophie has the kind of legs women would kill for, but she is taller, and hers are longer than mine, but I think my little legs are a little more sexy. I think about asking for a picture of the three of us, but don't know them well enough to know whether they would be okay with this.\n\nSophie is clearly the clever one of the group, she talks so well, using words I wouldn't even know to use, and I can imagine her as a scientist or businesswoman, or maybe working with computers, she really is that smart. I listen to her and Rachel talk, and it is clear they like men as much as I do, and Sophie gets a fair amount of action, more than Rachel, maybe even more than me, although that would probably mean she is having constant sex. Why, yes, I am a horny little girl, I love to feel a man deep inside me, but that's a story for another day. Autumn brings up her friend Michelle, a woman she knows who works as a strip-o-gram.\n\n\"Remember Michelle, the girl I brought to meet us?\" asks Autumn, holding her coffee with both of her small hands.\n\n\"Oh yeah, the stripper,\" says Rachel, a little dismissively. \"Not for me, thanks.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I couldn't do it,\" says Amelie, laughing. \"Imagine me jumping out of whatever it is in  a skimpy bikini, my cock bulging the lower part out. The guys would freak out, well, unless they wanted pegging by a hung t-girl like me.\" She, and the others laugh, and I smile, still a little nervous in their company. While I am confident enough to go out dressed they seem more at ease in their feminine personas. Perhaps it's because I am new to the city, having moved here after college for work, and don't know the place as well as they do.\n\n\"You could do it, Soph,\" says Autumn. \"You'd look good all dressed up\"\n\n\"Until they find out I'm a guy in a dress,\" says Sophie in an almost withering tone. \"Then it'd go to shit real fast.\"\n\n\"What about Michelle?\" I ask, managing to find my voice and feeling more confident that I can interact without worry of being shut down.\n\nAutumn looks at me. \"Well she has an appointment on Saturday night but she is double-booked and needs someone to cover for her. I said I'd ask around but the girls on the estate I asked didn't want to know.\"\n\nI furrow my brow a little. \"Estate?\"\n\n\"Council estate, where the poor people live,\" says Rachel. \"Autumn hangs around them, don't you sweetie?\"\n\nThis is strange news to me as they told me Autumn's parents are loaded, live in a massive house, and have two very nice cars. I wouldn't have thought Autumn would hang around on rough estates, especially being as femme as she is.\n\n\"You hang around on them? God, you must be very brave,\" I say.\n\n\"She has this magical aura that prevents any harm from coming to her,\" says Sophie. \"No-one in the city gives her any shit at all.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" says Rachel. \"No-one knows how she does it.\"\n\nAutumn laughs, a soft laugh, and shrugs.\n\n\"And,\" I say, drawing the word out. \"You thought one of us could cover for her? Surely when they find out we are not actual women with vaginas the guys would go mad, and we'd be in trouble; the agency would be getting complaints.\"\n\n\"It's okay, it's not actually a stripping job, you don't have to take any clothes off.\" Autumn pauses. \"But...\"\n \n\"But?\" I ask. I am intrigued even though I can't see any of us covering for Michelle.\n\n\"The order is for a someone in a bunny outfit,\" says Autumn.\n\nRachel and Sophie laugh. \"Count me right out,\" says Rachel.\n\n\"And me. Can't stand that black leotard and tights thing,\" says Sophie.\n\n\"How about you? You'd look great in it, honestly,\" says Autumn. \"And there's no sex involved, just gotta sing happy birthday, hop around and make sexy bunny noises a bit and that's about it.\"\n\n\"Bunny noises? I thought they made squeaky noises, eek, eek,\" says Rachel and laughs. \"God, that is so not for me. I'd feel... what's the word?\"\n\n\"Demeaned,\" says Sophie. \"Degraded, although I wouldn't mind being degraded by the right guy. Marcus at the snooker club degraded me once, and god was he ever good at it.\"\n\n\"Probably something to do with his big black cock,\" says Rachel, almost dismissively, or perhaps she is a little jealous, I can't tell for sure.\n\n\"Yeah, he proper ploughed Soph's ass-pussy,\" says Amelie. \"Wish I could find someone to let me plough them who also wanted to plough me.\"\n\n\"You will, hon,\" says Sophie. \"Just got to look in the right places. And no, Grindr is not the right place.\"\n\n\"How would you know? Been trawling profiles on there late at night - again?\" says Amelie, smirking.\n\n\"I don't need bloody Grindr to get some cock,\" says Sophie. \"I can find it when I want to.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we know,\" says Rachel. Although they are clearly friends there is definitely, it seems to me, some tension there. I want to ask about it but again I feel a little intimidated by these girls. They seem so casual about being out dressed and talking with one another about their sex lives or lack of them that I am still getting used to. I mean, I do it with my friends back home, but I knew them well, had known them for years, so it was different. Here I feel a bit of an outsider and am still finding my feet as they say with this new group.\n\n\"So what do you think?\" asks Autumn, looking at me. She is almost smirking and I wonder if I am being set up. I don't know these girls well right now but I wouldn't have thought they'd set up another t-girl, put her in an awkward, difficult, or even slightly dangerous situation.\n\nI look around the group to see they are all looking at me, then back at Autumn. \"Are you really asking me?\" My tone is somewhat incredulous as I am really not sure what is going on here. Amelie reaches over and takes my hand.\n\n\"Don't worry, we aren't trying to set you up here, we aren't like that. One thing we are not is a bunch of bitchy queens always looking to outdo one another,\" she says.\n\n\"Or set one another up to fail, leave one of us in an awful situation while we all laugh about it,\" says Sophie. \"We might argue from time to time,\" she glances at Rachel who laughs, \"but we are friends and we try to support one another.\"\n\n\"Go on, I dare you,\" says Rachel. She makes chicken noises: \"buk buk buk.\"\n\n\"So who is the guy?\" I ask.\n\n\"It's just this guy, he's a bit shy, a bit introverted, maybe a bit nerdy. Studies history as far as I can tell, although I can't remember exactly what she said now as it was some long, complex course name,\" says Autumn.\n\n\"Is he okay with t-girls? Is he gay? Bi? Straight? Oh god, if he's straight I'll be well fucked. Or rather not well fucked at all,\" I say, attempting some humour.\n\n\"He's straight, okay, maybe not straight, I am not sure to be honest with you,\" says Autumn. \"Michelle didn't have the exact details.\"\n\n\"But if he ordered Michelle as a strip-o-gram then surely he is straight? I don't get it, why would he be okay with me?\" I ask.\n\n\"His friends placed the order for his birthday,\" says Autumn. \"So I got the details of who he is from Michelle and checked him out.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\" says Rachel in an arch manner, as if she believes Autumn has stalked his online profiles.\n\n\"How?\" I ask.\n\n\"She has her ways, best not to ask,\" says Amelie.\n\n\"Oh, okay. So, er...\" I stumble to a halt.\n\n\"Go on, it'll be fun. And he won't be any trouble. Maybe he'll turn out to be a fun guy when you get to know him,\" says Autumn.\n\n\"Or maybe he'll geekily bang on about computer games for ages and ages and I'll have to sit there bored shitless, smiling as if I am at all interested,\" I say.\n\n\"You'll be okay, it isn't a long gig. You just do the catsuit thing, and then you can go once you've sung happy birthday to him,\" says Autumn.\n\n\"And what if he and his friends take offence that I am a t-girl?\" I ask.\n\n\"You report it to Michelle and she will tell the agency and they will get involved. Trust me, the agency is run by this big gang boss, a guy called Mack. He doesn't take kindly to the girls who work for him being mistreated,\" says Autumn.\n\nThere is a strange silence around the table in response to this comment. I had no idea who Mack was, but the rest of them clearly knew who he was, and even just a mention of his name seemed to scare them. A gang boss? That worried me even more.\n\n\"Won't he be angry when he finds out what happened and I did the gig?\" I ask.\n\n\"Mack won't give a fuck as long as he got paid. And once paid I doubt these guys would dare ask for their money back. And like I said, any mistreatment and the people who mistreated you will seriously regret it, trust me on this,\" says Autumn.\n\n\"She's right about that,\" says Amelie. She looks at Autumn. \"Did Michelle tell the agency about getting a stand-in?\"\n\n\"Of course, she isn't stupid, she wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of Mack. They said it was fine but the fee would go to the stand in, so you'll make some dosh as well,\" says Autumn.\n\n\"Go on, do it. Do it, do it, do it,\" says Rachel.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm with Rachel cause I really want to see what happens,\" says Amelie. \"And as Autumn says, you won't have to worry because Mack has your back.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sophie?\" I ask.\n\n\"It's up to you, girl. I doubt anything bad will happen, for the reasons already stated. But if you do it you need to give us the details of what happened at some point.\"\n\n\"Where would I get the outfit from? I don't have one, and I have an outfit for pretty much every occasion,\" I say.\n\n\"Come on, I'll take you to the agency and get you all kitted out,\" says Autumn. She finished the last of her now cold cappuccino and stood up. \"Come on, girl, lets go.\"\n\nAlmost as if in a dream and in a state of utter disbelief I find myself standing. Maybe it's the peer pressure, or maybe it's because I can't resist a dare, but I find myself taking Autumn's outstretched hand and walking off with her as the girls call out \"good luck\" and \"have fun\" to me.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I ran into some trouble with the length while trying to get this posted. I had to split it into two parts. I hope you enjoy, and can hopefully help me to better understand this event. Here is a link to Part 1 in case you didn't see it already!\r  \n\r  \n[Link to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bnpks5/part_1_i_thought_she_was_my_sister/)\r  \n\r  \nMy Account (continued):\r  \n\r  \nThe drive home was silent, between the hum of our car on the road and the darkness of the night around me I quickly fell asleep. As my mind slowed down, and I faded from reality, dreams filled my mind. I saw myself from the third person, sitting asleep in the middle row. I was nothing more than an observer now, confused but comfortable.\r  \n\r  \nI saw my grandpa driving the car, my grandma sitting next to him, an indiscernible conversation taking place between them. My younger brother was also fast asleep just a seat over from me sucking his thumb and as I brought my gaze back towards the front of the car I saw my sister.\r  \n\r  \nI could see her through the rear view mirror sitting straight up, having positioned herself in the middle of the car\u2019s back row. She had one arm resting rigidly by her side, and the other arm was stiff and pointing straight up, bending at the wrist where her hand touched the roof. Her smile was wider than before, and there was drool dripping from the corners of her mouth.\r  \n\r  \nI watched in horror as she craned her head to the right, stopping when her gaze met my sleeping body. With one fluid motion she swung her arm in my direction and then grabbed my throat. I tried to scream at myself to wake up, but as she tightened her grip, I watched helplessly as my face and lips began to turn blue.\r  \n\r  \nShe was now laughing, a deafening guttural laugh, my skin tone had now gone from blue to a dark violet shade of purple. Desperate to make it stop, I reached for my sister and pulled her shoulders towards me. She didn\u2019t budge. I tried again, but to no avail. I was starting to panic now, pulling and tugging at her, watching as she only tightened the death grip she had on my throat.\r  \n\r  \nAs far as I could tell, she didn\u2019t see me or register that I was there. All she was focused on was my body asleep in the middle row. I need to wake myself up, it was now the only option that made sense to me. I positioned myself next to where I was sleeping and began to repeatedly hit my face.\r  \n\r  \nThe sleeping version of me, didn't seem to register that he was being assaulted. Not only was my deranged sister choking me out, but in an almost theatrical performance I also was now punching myself hard enough to draw blood. My cheeks, forehead, and lips were purple, due to my lack of oxygen. My nose was broken and blood poured down my face and into my mouth.\r  \n\r  \nHorror spread itself through my body when my I saw my sister suddenly yank her hand back, her iron grip still trained on my throat. With a wet, soggy sound, my throat was ripped from my neck, blood spraying the car landing on my brother and grandparents. Though soaked in blood they didn\u2019t seem to register what had just happened, and as I took in the crime scene before me that now looked like some sick version of modern art, my vision started to fade to black.\r  \n\r  \nI gasped violently as I sat up in my seat, goosebumps lining my small frame. I reached for my throat, afraid it was torn out, but realized that was silly as I had just gasped for air. My grandparents must not have realized I was having a bad dream, as my grandma turned slightly when I woke and formed a pleasant smile.\r  \n\r  \n\"Hey grandma, how far are we from the house?\" I asked, my mouth still dry from sleep, my heart still pounding from the disturbing dream beginning to fade into my subconscious.\r  \n\r  \n\"We are almost home honey.\" Turning to my grandpa she said ,\r  \n\r  \n\"Dan how much farther we got?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Only about 5 minutes. Pat, can you wake your siblings? That amusement park musta been exhausting, you three slept the whole way home.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"We were definitely very tired. I will wake them.\" I said, still apprehensive towards my sister who was fast asleep in the row behind me.\r  \n\r  \nI shook my brother away, his eyelids fluttering as he fought waking confusion. Before I reached for my sister, I instinctively glanced in the mirror, half expecting to see her chilling smile staring back at me. Thankfully she wasn't, and still looked to be peacefully sleeping. I shook my sister but she didn't wake. I shook her again, still no sign of her waking.\r  \n\r  \n\"Grandma, Stace won't wake up.\" I said facing the front again. \"I tried twice and she won't respond. Can you or grandpa wake her?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Sure thing honey, I'll make sure she gets inside. Must have been an extra long day for her, she has never been a heavy sleeper.\"\r  \n\r  \nMy grandma turned back to face the front and before long she announced that we had arrived home. I swung open my door and spilled out onto the half dirt half concrete driveway in front of the house. The sound of the ignition turning off amplified the already deafening silence, and the forest around me seemed to extend out towards infinity. My grandpa opened the door to the house, and ushered myself and my little brother inside.\r  \n\r  \n(I would like to take a quick moment to explain the layout of my grandparents house before I get into this part of my experience. My grandparents lived in a fairly large and spread out one story house, surrounded by the forest. They lived just on the edge of their small town and there were only a couple houses near them in their small neighborhood. The house itself was old, seeming somewhat outdated, but besides that it was a nice house. When you first enter the house through the front door, you are faced with a normal sized living room. To the left is a staircase leading to the basement and a hallway leading to four bedrooms. To the right is a doorway leading to the kitchen, and straight ahead is another doorway leading to the dining room with a view to the backyard and the forest surrounding it. Also in this room is the guest bathroom, just big enough for one person. With the house laid out in your mind, I will continue.)\r  \n\r  \nI walked straight through the living room and into the dining room, banking right towards the bathroom door. As I finished my business and turned to wash my hands, I heard the front door open, my grandma speaking to someone on the phone. I dried off my hands on a dark green towel hanging next to the sink and then opened the door, stepping back into the second living room. The house was awfully quiet when I exited the bathroom, confused as I no longer heard my grandmother\u2019s voice coming from the conversation she was having on the phone just moments earlier. Where is everyone I thought as I slowly made my way back into the living room.\r  \n\r  \nThe only light in the living room was a small lamp, resting on a stand next to the couch, providing just enough light for me to see my surroundings. Everyone must have gone to bed I thought as I turned towards the hallway lined with rooms, yawning as fatigue took hold of me. As I got closer, something in me told me to turn around. My gut was screaming at me, begging me to abandon the direction I was headed in. I stopped just before rounding the corner, taking a deep breath to steady myself, the warning my body was conferring to me stronger than ever.\r  \n\r  \nPrepared to face the unknown, I rounded the corner and came to an abrupt stop just shy of the hallway\u2019s entrance. The light from the lamp behind me, cast a small sliver of light down the dark empty hall. As I scanned the long corridor, I noticed a figure standing by the back wall. They had their back to me and were motionless, resembling a mannequin you would see on display in a Sears department store. I stood still watching the figure as they remained motionless, but as I looked closer I realized it was a young girl. Her hair was dark and messy, hanging against her thin frame. She seemed awfully skinny, her limbs offset by the grey pajamas she was wearing.\r  \n\r  \n\"He..hello who's there!\" I said, raising my voice, but only enough for her to hear me. Silence was her response, no movement almost as if my words had fallen on deaf ears.\r  \n\r  \nI opened my mouth to repeat my question, when a quiet but high pitched giggle broke the silence reverberating off the walls of the hallway. The sound hit me and a wave of chills suddenly coursed through me. Instinctively I took a quick step backwards, resting my hand on the edge of the wall to stabilize my quivering legs. The ability to speak was now a notion of the past, as I helplessly watched the girl turn her shoulder towards me revealing half of her face-darkness obscuring her features.\r  \n\r  \nShe gradually raised her arm in my direction, and as if this were some cruel joke with a single finger motioned me to come towards her. At that moment, I saw the image of my sister in the crowd, half turned and motioning me towards her with her finger. The girl at the end of the hall and my sister in the crowd were one and the same. A pitiful whine escaped my lips as I took another step backwards entering the threshold of the first living room. I kept my vision trained on who I now thought was my sister, fear boiling up inside me.\r  \n\r  \nUp until this point, my sister had never done anything strange or out of the ordinary. She was very grounded and mature for being only ten years old, so this behavior she displayed today was bone chilling. Her arm was still pointed in my direction, and as I looked closer I felt my body go numb. I tried to move but was frozen, unable to pull my sight from my sister. With no control of my body, I felt my foot lift and move me in the direction of the hallway. I no longer felt in control, slowly being drawn to the evil awaiting me at the end of the hall. Suddenly she spun to face the wall again, before she dropped her raised arm violently, bolting into the bedroom directly to the left of her. As soon as she disappeared from my view, I heard my grandmother\u2019s voice.\r  \n\r  \n\"Pat, could you come here real quick? I need some help in the kitchen.\"\r  \n\r  \nNow free from the grip that held me in place, I turned to face the entrance to the kitchen and called back,\r  \n\r  \n\"Coming grandma, uh just give me one second!\"\r  \n\r  \nNo longer wishing to see what would unfold next, I started in the kitchen's direction, but stopped after a few steps, the sudden feeling of being watched to intense to shake. Turning around slower than I ever have, I looked back over my shoulder to the doorway my sister had ran into. In abject horror, I saw my sister peaking at me from around the corner of the door frame. Her horrific, stretched smile was on full display and her eyes were shrouded in all consuming darkness. There was blood pouring out of her nose, and her neck was bent at an unnatural angle, almost as if it was broken. I stumbled backwards, breaking from the trance-like state I had just found myself in. Practically falling into the kitchen, I saw my grandma washing the last of the dishes that were stacked in the sink. She turned to me, her hand outstretched a towel resting between her fingers.\r  \n\r  \n\"Here Pat, could you dry these dishes quickly for me?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Uh yes grandma, I think I can do that.\" I said, grabbing the towel and then standing next to her picking up the first plate from the soap soaked stack.\r  \n\r  \nAs I dried the dishes, I couldn't help but imagine her still there, now farther up the hall peeking at me from another doorway. Any second now she was going to come bolting towards the kitchen on all fours, like the girl crawling out of the TV in the movie The Ring. As I set the fourth plate down though, I knew that she wasn't going to be coming any closer tonight.\r  \n\r  \n\"Hey grandma, I have a question.\" I said hesitantly, the fear of her giving me an answer I didn't want to hear present in the silence that followed.\r  \n\r  \n\"What's on your mind Pat? Something bothering you?\" her eyes were trained on me, and I knew she could see the jumble of emotions proudly presenting themselves to her through my heavy eyes.\r  \n\r  \n\"Did Stace come inside tonight? I know I couldn't get her to wake up when she was sleeping in the back of the car.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Your grandpa said he saw her walk past your brother's room, he assumes she went to her bed. The car is locked and I didn't see her when I looked through the front windshield. She should be inside now, Why do you ask?\" Her voice seemed to trail off as she finished her sentence, as if she was suddenly much more interested in what I had to say.\r  \n\r  \n\"It's probably nothing, but I swear I saw her smiling at me again from the end of the hall. It was the same face she made earlier in the crowd. It was dark though and I couldn't see very well. Maybe it was just the shadows playing tricks on me.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"You know Pat, you've had a long stressful day. Don't let it bother you too much, I bet it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Let's finish these dishes so I can bring you to bed.\"\r  \n\r  \nI nodded my head to signal I understood, and then focused my attention on the dishes in front of me.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a little while I finished the dishes and followed my grandmother out of the kitchen towards the hallway I had just run from. I felt myself hesitating as we neared it, a cold sweat breaking out on the back of my neck. Reaching for my grandma\u2019s hand, I grasped it and squeezed tightly in an attempt to stop the sudden onslaught of anxiety. I managed to keep my cool as my grandma brought me into my room and tucked me into bed. She then turned around and walked out the door, blowing me a kiss before disappearing back down the hall. I could just almost imagine my sister peeking through the small slit between the door and the door frame, her smile so wide it had split the skin at the corners of her mouth. Pulling the covers tight over my face, I hid myself from that thought, counting imaginary sheep jumping an imaginary fence, till a light sleep overtook me and my brain shut down for the night.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning I woke to find my door undisturbed, the terror from the night before now no more than a distant dream. As I left the bedroom and entered the living room, I was greeted by the smell of bacon and pancakes, as well as the distinct and strong acrid smell of fresh coffee. I had never had coffee, but with how much my dad drank swore by it, I assumed it must be pretty delicious. I entered the kitchen to see my parents, grandparents, and two siblings, all sitting at the table. I felt hesitant when I saw my sister, but fought the urge to distance myself from her, though to me it felt completely rational. They were conversing, going silent between bites of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Plopping into my chair my mom turned to me and said,\r  \n\r  \n\"Morning sunshine, how did you sleep?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I slept well enough, yesterday was interesting.\" I said, faking the cheery tone in my voice.\r  \n\r  \n\"I'm so sorry we weren't there for you yesterday when you got lost. We still feel so awful.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Don't worry mama, I'm okay now I was just a little scared is all.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I know honey, but your papa and I still feel bad.\" She said as she turned back to eat her food.\r  \n\r  \nI picked up my fork ready to dig into the feast before me, when my grandmother touched my hand from where she sat across from me.\r  \n\r  \n\"Pat, there is something I needed to tell you this morning when you woke up. Last night you asked if your sister made it inside. I told you she had, having been told by your grandpa that she went to her room. He was wrong though, and in turn so was I. Your sister never made it in the house last night.\"\r  \n\r  \nInches from my mouth, my fork suddenly left my fingers and came crashing down on the ceramic plate that lay under it, the sound of metal on ceramic reverberating through the kitchen. Before I could truly process this information my grandma continued saying,\r  \n\r  \n\"At around 3 AM last night your grandpa and I were awoken by the sound of someone pounding on the front door. Your grandpa left our bedroom quickly, grabbed his hand gun, then went to investigate the disturbance. I got up shortly after I heard him unlock the door, and welcome in the sobs of your sister. She was crying and shaking, barely making any sense, but after we brought her in and let her come to her senses we realized what had happened. After your grandpa let you and your brother into the house, I grabbed our belongings from the car and went inside the house. Turns out, the stress and exhaustion from our mishap at the amusement park had caused me to forget that your sister was asleep in the back seat. I assume she had lain down on her side, blocking her view from the front of the car. I should have checked to make sure she had made it inside but I believed your grandpa\u2019s assurance that she was asleep in her room. Then you of course also asked me late yesterday if she was inside, because you swore you had seen her. Regardless, she never made it inside last night, it seems crazy, but we left her in the car.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI was overcome with the memories and visceral images of my sister smiling at me from behind the door frame of her guest bedroom. I no longer tried to hide the emotions I was feeling, horror awakening nausea in my empty stomach. This can't be true, God please don't let this be true. I saw her last night, I know I did. I'm not crazy right? Am I? Was she really not there?\r  \n\r  \nThoughts came flying at me from all directions, as I closed my eyes tight, trying to make sense of this horrifying confession. I realized as I sat at the table, drawn far from reality, late last night as I stood at the threshold of the hallway, I had been moments from meeting evil itself. Whatever had taken hold of my sister craved my innocent soul, needing it for a reason still unbeknownst to me. It had entranced me and I knew that if my grandmother's voice hadn't broken its grip, I would have blindly followed the evil that gleefully awaited my demise.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of the trip was uneventful but far from peaceful. I chose not to say anything about it to my parents, aside from some small answers devoid of detail. I felt like reliving it and spreading the story would somehow give the evil more power, and a six year old didn't want to have that power lurking in his life. The events of that bone chilling night with time became distant, but they were not out of my mind.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't help but see her everywhere I looked. She was always there, hiding in my peripherals, smiling and watching. Part of me felt like she was in on it, but the other part of me saw her as my sweet caring sister. Maybe there were two sides to her, the hidden side only shown to me and the sweet innocent side on display for the rest of society. Either way, I had decided I wouldn't mention it to her and instead let the nightmare fade away like every other memory that entered the dark recesses of my mind.\r  \n\r  \nFifteen years later, I still feel the same as I did when I first saw her in the crowd of people at the amusement park. I have moved on from the fear of my sister, never having seen that smile again, but I still haven't shaken the terror that dug itself deep into me that night. Even now as I am writing this, a college graduate, fully immersed in the life of a 9-5 job, I still get chills when I let myself go back to the threshold of that hallway.\r  \n\r  \nI don't think I will ever understand what happened to my sister throughout that day. If her behavior in the hallway had been the only strange interaction I had with her during this day, I would have chalked it off as my mind playing tricks on me, forcing me to see things that weren't actually there. But the incident in the hall was the fourth time I had seen that unforgettable grin, and I know now that it wasn't a mistake, or a \"figment\" of my imagination like everyone else had tried to convince me it was.\r  \n\r  \nI wish I could figure out what had happened to her. Maybe that's why I am writing this, hoping someone can help me understand. Was something imitating her? Did my sister have a mental break? Had I succumbed to a mental break? These thoughts and many more are all trivial though, and don't bring the intense fear like the one question I asked myself the day after this all happened. To this day I still ask myself and those few who I have told the account to this question.\r  \n\r  \n***What was waiting for me at the end of the hall, and what would have happened if my grandmother hadn't called me into the kitchen?***",

        "selftext": "Snail: In the deep depths of YouTube, a man began his journey to stardom, a rise, through food\n\nBowser: A man would find his place by explaining games with food, however, he would eventually find himself on Twitch! With a little group called twitch chat!\n\nSnail: \u2026 this was an analysis written about a YouTuber, give us a break\n\nBowser: DougDoug would make a name for himself with his coding, being able to change the very fabric of the games he plays, or use AI to tell grand stories. This also includes the sassy war general AI Napoleon for some reason\u2026 the most sassy potshot taking AI you\u2019ve ever seen with immense vibrating anal bead power! Wait what-\n\nSnail: And these skills would do him well! He can spawn in characters like Kirby, Link, Doomslayer, Kratos, Skyrim Giants, cows yes cows, Masterchief, and even school teachers the bastards! Did you know much teachers are old out of touch power hungry maniacs?!\n\nBowser: Chill Snail\u2026 \n\nSnail: Lets talk more in depth about what their summons can do! Mario can create cloud platforms! Kratos is a god killer with an axe! Master chief nobody knows!\n\nBowser: He\u2019s also able to change the course of a story simply by typing. Allowing him to alter reality as is.\n\nSnail: And not just that, he can lose at Peggle speed runs, kill 25 children, and even bring apocalypses to his own cities.\n\nBowser: But he is hardly a solo act, he\u2019s accompanied by the true main character, twitch chat! They even fought over who can take over more of Europe! And the USA!\n\nSnail: With the power of chat, they can spawn in dragons and thieves and wolves and cheese nuts, gottem! But both DougDoug and Twitch Chat are solely being well equipped to fight in a war or with weapons! Also they are capable of eating Delaware somehow\u2026 good thing they didn\u2019t  get the chance! They\u2019re even smart enough to create space travel and convert the moon into a spaceship.\n\nBowser: Chat is also shockingly smart with random facts like the amount of cheese variants that exist around the world! They\u2019re even able to revive after being killed and revive others!\n\nBowser: More importantly though, they can access the power of the dev console, allowing them to teleport people to Tahiti, space, or even beneath the world itself! They can even erase people from reality!\n\nSnail: They\u2019ve even played as people like Sonic and the Dovahkiin! The former of which can accelerate through time by sheer speed! And effect Sonic\u2019s multiverse! As for the latter? Well they can carry cheese wheels assuming these weigh about 80 ponds and taking the number in total the Dovahkiin can carry about 2000 we determined DougDoug and Twitch chat can carry roughly 160000 pounds!\n\nBowser: Almost as much as-\n\nSnail: You\u2019re mom?\n\nBowser: \u2026 But even when they fight for who is the true main character, they eventually make up and help each other out.\n\nSnail: Chat would help Doug find socks and play games, while Doug can enhance Chat\u2019s speed.\n\nBowser: While they may have disagreements and murderous fights, they always come back together in the end, even with the wars they fight \n\nSnail: Even when they war with Saul Goodman, Jesus, alcohol, bear knights, popes, and the sun, they always come back together in the end, ready for a crazy adventure.\n\n-\n\nSnail: Located in the center of Europe was Latveria a seemingly peaceful nation under a ruler like no other. A ruler that just so happened to be one of the most powerful villains in the marvel universe.\n\nBowser: Doom started from not great beginnings. His mother had her soul taken by the demon Mephisto and his father died in the freezing cold while running from an evil ass motherfucker\u2026 we went from funny streamer man geez\u2026\n\nSnail: Doom did what anyone would do in his early life. Invent. Well what any mad scientist might!\n\nBowser: He got himself a collage education but after scaring his face he decided fuck it and went to get himself a mask! And a suit to hide his face!\n\nSnail: No the mask was his face! As Doom and his suit evolves beyond the confines of insanity and reaches into the beyond.\n\nBowser: Doom can fly and use a mix of technology and magic. His tech is so advanced even Reed Richards one of the smartest men alive can\u2019t hack his tech! It\u2019s as easy as logging someone out your old musty ass PC for Doom!\n\nSnail: Doom can use his magic to create force fields, create electricity that can shook through insulating gloves! He also has giant green fuck off lasers! And he can retool them to amp his own power! \n\nBowser: His suit has pieces of the holy cross that keep vampires away for some reason so all unholy things beware! It can even react and adapt on its own! And he has an ice bomb\u2026 guess what that does\u2026 if you guessed create ice you\u2019d be right!\n\nSnail: Doom has been thrown in between the comic panels by Gwenpool and in only a few minutes built a device that allowed him return to the panels! And he didn\u2019t even know what was going on!\n\nBowser: And this ain\u2019t the only insane bullshit Doom has done! He\u2019s beaten Galactus the devourer of worlds and a concept entangled with and making up Marvel\u2019s greater omniverse!\n\nSnail: What the fuck-\n\nBowser: His powers are even stronger than the Beyonder\u2019s marvel\u2019s heaviest hitters!\n\nSnail: He can also affect Wanda with his powers who\u2019s an equal to Jean Gray with the Phoenix Force! The Phoenix Force is able to mend the white hot room to her whim being one of the highest points in Marvel\u2019s cosmology! Even transcending the beyonders a race of aliens who transcend Marvel\u2019s omniverse!\n\nBowser: Obviously Doom had no issue overthrowing his home country and it prospered under his rule! And he wondered if he could make his home better by taking it over then the world she be next!\n\nSnail: And he\u2019s right according to his precognition! But the fantastic four and the avengers always seem to stop him sucks to suck! And it doesn\u2019t help he loses cosmic power at the worse time! As while he can absorb power with the COSMIC POWER SIPHON he can\u2019t always retain it. At least he\u2019s fast as shit tho.\n\nBowser: Doctor Doom can keep pace with Thor who can travel through time with sheer speed and Doom can time travel himself with magic!\n\nSnail: Doom is a genius as an inventor and in combat. Thor is a god of thunder who Doom has fought and beaten on several occasion and he\u2019s been around for thousands of years!\n\nBowser: Doom has banished people to other dimensions and thousands of years into the past! And turned matter into energy!\n\nSnail: Doom has anti-matter bombs, can scramble your molecules and can even toot! That dastardly bastard! He can warp reality itself and turn all of reality into a game board with machines!\n\nBowser: Why doesn\u2019t he do all this more often! He\u2019s one of the smartest men in marvel and a contender for sorcerer supreme!?\n\nSnail: Doom\u2019s reason are his own and shall not be questioned. Much like marvel\u2019s favorite retcon device! Doombots! Perfect replicas for Doom\u2019s army that he can use to fake his own death! And justify him losing to the fucking Kingpin.\n\nBowser: Huh\u2026? Why does he need them when he can summon avenger stalling armies at a whim?\n\nSnail: But even still Doom became a god and got everything and while his powers were sealed away by Reed he reflected and became Ironman\u2026 to make up. He realized his ego was his own weakness.\n\nBowser: But in the end even that couldn\u2019t stop him\u2026 he was back to his old egotistical ways! If not even a multiversal rest can stop Doom nothing will! He\u2019s unapologetic Doctor Doom! And nothing is gonna stop him!",

        "selftext": "When I was 17, I made a friend online who was 23. We are both gay males and were very immature. Sometimes, I would listen to his prank calls on 3way dial and we'd laugh about it after. I was very self-suppressed and lived vicariously through him. It was always really childish and dumb, never serious. Later, he started dating a guy his age and together they asked me to join them sexually. I declined and things got weird. I suddenly started receiving massive amounts of prank calls on my personal cell and my mom's landline. She refused to change her phone number and resented me for bringing this baggage into her life. We adjusted privacy settings to block unknown numbers. That's when the caller ID started ringing as my friend's boyfriend's name. I assumed they were both behind it, given my friend's history of prank calls and the timing, but my friend denied it and seemingly pretended not to believe my claims about his boyfriend. I assume he knew about all of it anyway. His boyfriend couldn't deny solid proof, but he tried. CallerIDFaker-like software wasn't available back then and I didn't know anyone smart enough to fake a caller ID in those days. Plus, Occam's Razor says that the most simple answer is typically the truth; the boyfriend was behind it. My family already had trouble accepting me and these nonstop calls pissed them off, which was very hard on me. It was like baggage that came with me and they resented me for it. I had no control over what another person chose to do. Obviously, my \"friend\" and his boyfriend were extremely insecure and didn't take kindly to being told \"no.\" Sometimes I would sleep with the cordless in my room so I could pick it up when the calls inevitably continued throughout the night, to avoid waking up my folks, and I'd go to work exhausted and always worried about the amount of missed calls I'd have to clear before everyone got home to see it. It happened almost every hour of the day. I came home to 255 missed calls in 1 single day. I would block number after number and 15 mins later, he'd call from a new number with the same caller ID name. This repeated with 15+ different phone numbers. I also found out it that cost $15 to change a number with Verizon, so the only time I had peace is when he must've inevitably billed to his account and maxed out that allowance, which shut off his service until it was paid. Eventually, they broke up, but that ex-boyfriend continued calling and harassing me. It started escalating from childish prank calls to scary and specific threats that were never followed up on, and then my identity was impersonated on social media to tarnish my reputation. I NEVER did anything to this person, so it really baffled me how much time and effort he put into being a nuisance. Tons of friends, family, and coworkers would confronted me about the accounts in my name, which had sent them horrific messages that included very poor deep-fakes of me. It was always embarrassing, to say the least. Cops did nothing but take my report, but would call me with warnings when he reversed victim and offender. It really pissed me off how credulous law enforcement was, plus, I know they didn't wanna deal with young gay drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Revenge: After several months of this, I found his nudes on craigslist and thought, FUCK YOU! I photoshopped them to look even uglier, printed stacks of copies with the title \"Hi I'm HIS-NAME, I'm your front desk clerk,\" and enlisted a close friend to help me spread them far and wide around his job, where he worked as the check-in for a hotel. We put on disguises and posted these copies on car windows, under hotel doors, and pulled a total Regina George through the hallways by tossing them everywhere. My mom finally cancelled her landline and he couldn't get through anymore, prompting the impersonating accounts to maximize. I found out he got a new job and I repeated this same thing. I was very non-specific by eluding to the photo-revenge and threatened to do it again if he didn't leave me alone. I stopped hearing from him immediately. <3",

Since the target was an adult (it wasn't child pornography), and the images in question were not distributed online (it wasn't a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) or for profit (it wasn't extortion), there's nothing left but the weak civil claim. And since the target in question already knew that OP was responsible (given the context of the post), there's no new information here.

No brothers and sisters, dad was in and out of prison, etc.\n\nWell I believe it's from this that around 10 years old I became detached from my emotions, I never found joy being around others. During Christmas I always faked being happy about gifts and metting family, always forcing a smile, I hated leaving the house, and I couldn't give less of a shit about the emotions of others, wither that be my Mom or Dad.\n\nI'm nearly 22 now and I still struggle greatly with this. I don't have any friends nor do I go out of my way to make any, every time I try to start a relationship with someone, I very quickly lose any sort of emotional connection I may of had with them within a week and cut them off. When my grandmother died someoneI was very close to as a child, I just couldn't find it in myself to feel sad, while everyone around me was crying, while my mother was clinging onto me bawling her eyes out, I just didn't care, no tears, no frowns, I was just there out of courtesy. \n\nI go out of my way to makes myself look good daily, good hygiene, working out daily, dressing nice, and making sure I always stay groomed.I can put on a mask, put on a charming smile and sound enthusiastic when speaking to others, but that's just a skill a picked up from work, I genuinely couldn't care less what they have to say, nor do I even want to talk to them in the first place. \n\nDeep down I want connections, I want friends and a significant other, but every time I get close to achieving that, I just simply lose interest and isolate myself.\n\nWhat's wrong with me? Do I need therapy? Medication? I have many books on how to become a better person, but I just can't become who I want to become, I can't be there emotionally. \n\n",

That\u2019s just wrong. I\u2019m just being\u2026 very dumb.\u201d I managed out with a frustrated breath. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I don\u2019t know *what* to think right now Lysara.\u201d I instinctively reached for my forearm, wrapping my right arm across my chest in the process. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hitting me with revelation after revelation, Lysara. So much so that I don\u2019t know *what* to feel about Eslan now. And I know this is sounding like I\u2019m using that as an excuse to think and act immaturely, but it\u2019s really not that. It\u2019s just\u2026 *difficult*, you know? To make heads or tails of what\u2019s right or wrong for Eslan when you\u2019ve just been hit with the reality destroying revelation that the galaxy, no, the *universe* is completely messed up, and even more screwed up than your bombed-out irradiated world.\u201d I admitted outright, unsure at this point if I was trying to justify my own indecision, or whether or not I was just venting at this point. \n\n\u201cIt was my fault for being too conservative at first with regards to the divulgence of such\u2026 sensitive information, Evina.\u201d Lysara replied in the most reassuring tone he, and his translation software, could muster. \n\n\u201cNo, no. I mean, yeah maybe, but I could see myself noping out of there when we first met if you started this off with: *I\u2019m in a massive fight against an ancient alien conspiracy and your planet is now in the crosshairs*. So yeah, no, starting off slow was fine. It\u2019s just a lot to take in. And while I would say I need *time* to process everything, right now it\u2019s clear we don\u2019t really have that luxury when it comes to Eslan.\u201d I managed out with a deep sigh. \n\n\u201cWe *could* start a few more scans, buy ourselves more time to discuss this matter-\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No more lies.\u201d I shot down that idea reflexively, before realizing my outburst and its effects on the alien\u2019s features. \u201cSorry, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d I let out another breath, placing a palm against my face, before squeezing the bridge of my snout tightly; a quirk of my first iteration. \u201cI need to face him. I don\u2019t want to buy anymore time, especially if that time is based on covering up more truths. He\u2019s outright lied to my face for *years* about his \u2018inheritance\u2019. And if we start our whole conversation off with yet another lie, or hell, my first idea of simply *not* telling him anything\u2026 then I\u2019d be no better than that. Now, one of my prior iterations *might* have been more inclined to do that, but not me. At least, not when dealing with allies, let alone *friends*.\u201d \n\nThe alien nodded slowly. \u201cI admire your candid nature, Evina. All I can say however is that we shouldn\u2019t jump to any conclusions just yet. I\u2026 have reason to believe that interloper influence could be the reason behind Eslan\u2019s condition. I do not know specifically how, but I do know that given the track record of their meddling, that this wouldn\u2019t be out of the question.\u201d \n\nI let out a sigh in response to that, my eyes averting from his, as I tried my best *not* to chew him out for the: *it\u2019s the conspiracy\u2019s fault* argument. An argument which I heard one too many times down in the bunker as a catch-all term to explain away everything. But then again, I didn\u2019t know *what* to think right now. My mind was running at a million miles a minute and I was completely out of my depth right now. Heck, I was wearing my heart on my sleeve more than I *should* be at this point.\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d I relented. \u201cI won\u2019t jump to any conclusions. I won\u2019t\u2026 *get mad* I guess. Or at least, I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d There was a pause as the alien nodded with yet another \u2018smile\u2019. \u201cBut just know, Lysara, you\u2019re not the one who has to come to terms with the fact that the person who you trust the most, who you risked your life for time and time again, turns out to have been completely *faking* a vital, key, integral part of themselves for nearly a decade. You\u2019re not going to be the person who has to come to terms with the fact that someone you considered family looked you in the eye while spouting out thousands of hours\u2019 worth of heartfelt conversations about experiences that never existed. Because if it were me, I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t lie to someone I cared about for that long, even if it was a deep dark secret. So\u2026 I\u2019ll *try* my best Lysara, but understand if we don\u2019t get the answers we\u2019re looking for\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d \n\nLysara actually stopped what he was doing at that point, putting down his tablet face up, before placing a single hand on my shoulder. \u201cI won\u2019t specify exactly what *I* went through. This isn\u2019t that type of conversation, nor would it help. However, I\u2019d just like you to know, Evina, that I myself\u2026 have suffered greatly at the hands of having what were once unassailable truths, something so concrete to my own life, being ripped out from underneath me; revealed to me as nothing but complete fabrications. I\u2026 understand how you feel, Evina. And I just want you to know that it\u2019s okay to feel these sorts of emotions. Nothing I say right now will probably make you feel any better. These things take time to come to terms with. But I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone in these feelings, and that I\u2019m here should you need to talk further about this. I\u2019ll be with you throughout every step of this whole journey.\u201d The alien spoke earnestly, his eyes despite being so different, managed to convey those emotions perfectly; as his empathy momentarily calmed my growing bout of conflicting emotions\u2026 allowing me to coalesce on something more productive. \n\nInstead of focusing on the hurt that stemmed from what was potentially the greatest lie told to me, I instead focused on the other big point at hand - Eslan\u2019s confounding condition.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I spoke through a tired breath. \u201cJust get him out of there so we can talk to him.\u201d\n\n=====\n\n**75 Hours After the First Round of Interloper Interrogations. UNAFS Perseverance. Medbay.**\n\n**Eslan**\n\nAt first excitement welled within me, as I realized that I was finally going to receive some long-deserved answers to exactly *why* I was the way I was.\n\nThen, there was concern, upon finally being placed inside of the scanning chamber resembling one of those MRI machines that the bunker\u2019s clinic had stopped using a few centuries ago due to maintenance issues. \n\nConcern, stemming from a fear of exactly *what* I was going to hear. \n\nBecause frankly, whilst I *knew* there was something wrong, I never really paid it much mind with Evina around. As the only thing I focused my mind on were on the actual symptoms that disrupted my life, rather than the long term concerns over *what* this condition could mean for me.\n\nBut now? Now I was faced with the realization that I would finally know exactly *what* was wrong, and there was no more denying or hiding away from it.\n\n\u2026\n\nBut was that really a bad thing though?\n\nBecause even if it were life-threatening and severe\u2026 I was on a *spaceship*. I was in the care of aliens that had the capacity for *interstellar travel*! \n\nMy worldly concerns probably meant nothing compared to what they could offer me in terms of medical treatment! \n\nSure, I was an alien.\n\nSure, they didn\u2019t have much to go off of purely in terms of the quantity and quality of research materials or reference materials they had.\n\nBut they had *Evina* to cross check me with! \n\nThey had a healthy baseline, and enough texts that allowed them to help her recover from her own life threatening injuries!\n\nThat meant there was no reason for me to be worried.\n\nIn fact, the longer I sat here, the longer I sat reflecting about everything\u2026 the less I feared what awaited me on the other side of that door.\n\nAll I was really afraid of however, was the dark, as the machine dimmed and I was left in here for probably much longer than I should\u2019ve.\n\nBut then again, I didn\u2019t know *how* any of these things worked.\n\nAnd eventually, after some prompting, I was released from the confines of the metal tube. \n\nA hopeful grin was plastered across my face as I met Evina and Lysara\u2019s eyes. \n\nHowever, that grin was tempered somewhat by the worried expressions of both.\n\nIn fact, my faith in everything was shaken by Evina\u2019s signature stoic face taking the place of the formerly chipper and upbeat one she had just moments ago.\n\nWorry started to well in me again.\n\nBut I braved through it with a simple question. \n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what are the results? What do you have for me, doc?\u201d I asked in as upbeat of a voice as I could muster, chuckling nervously in an attempt to quell the intense mood.\n\nThe pair took a moment to meet each other\u2019s eyes before turning towards me again, Evina reluctantly agreeing to let Lysara take the charge.\n\n\u201cThe lab results told\u2026 quite a conflicting story, Eslan.\u201d The alien began with an attempt at positivity. \u201cDo you recall what your own tentative self-diagnosis was, Eslan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I responded with a nod. \u201cSome form of neurodegenerative disease, as part of a wider syndrome of accelerated musculoskeletal degenerative conditions; Atkarparling\u2019s Condition if my memory serves me right.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, the reference texts we managed to scrounge up does cover that. And indeed, if we were to take a look here-\u201d Lysara gestured towards the results of my scan, at several aspects of my brain and brainstem. \u201cIt is clear that the studies would support the diagnosis. However-\u201d That word hit me hard, but I tried my best to stay calm. \u201c-that\u2019s not the whole story. Because despite confirming the fact that you *do* have a *form* of accelerated neurodegenerative decay, the other lab results told a different story.\u201d \n\nThe alien paused, bringing up several other lab samples I had no concept of. \n\n\u201cEslan\u2026 it is difficult for me to put it in a way that a medical professional may otherwise be able to properly phrase. So I do apologize if my bedside manners are not up to par.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u2026 please, just, give me the full picture.\u201d\n\nThe alien nodded. \u201cYou see\u2026 the results point to a different pathological profile, one that I am unable to determine the exact cause of. Because your body, and its different organs, are all aging at rapidly different rates.\u201d That answer\u2026 took me by surprise, as I had literally no prior knowledge to pull from to determine just how bad that actually was, or what it even meant. \u201cMoreover\u2026 the results from your bone core biopsies are most telling. Tell me, Eslan, do you know Aslenparmouran\u2019s rule?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI had quite a bit of time to browse old medical texts during my downtime. Wasn\u2019t that the principle that determined that precise age could be determined using bone core biopsies?\u201d I answered truthfully.\n\n\u201cThat is correct, Eslan. And, barring a few key anomalies, this is generally one of the most surefire ways of determining a person\u2019s age. Now, after testing, and double, triple, and quadruple checking, your age, your *actual* age Eslan\u2026 was determined to be roughly a decade, give or take a few months in variability.\u201d \n\nMy mind didn\u2019t register that at all.\n\nIn fact, I felt part of me simply going *blank* at that answer, as if there was *something* in the back of my mind that understood its significance.\n\nBut nothing came through.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t understand.\u201d I responded truthfully.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unfortunately in the same boat right now, Eslan.\u201d The alien spoke empathetically. \u201cWhat we *do* know is that your various organ systems are aging at rapidly different rates, but the markers of your actual age are simply not lining up with the timeline of events that is your life.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any-\u201d\n\n\u201cEslan.\u201d Evina finally spoke up, her voice teetering on the edge of breaking that otherwise stoic expression. \u201cJust tell me the truth. Who exactly *are* you?\u201d \n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/vkksmy/humans_dont_hibernate/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1bit715/humans_dont_hibernate_part_87/) | Next\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Author\u2019s Note: Evina and Lysara continue to discuss about their best course of action, before Eslan rejoins them and certain revelations start being revealed one by one!

        "selftext": "  \n\n\nClub Vlad sat near the confluence of Central Avenue and Washington Avenue, Albany\u2019s two main thoroughfares. Two stories with blackout windows and a box office from when it used to be a movie theater, it was swarmed with people when Dom first spotted it ahead. He was somewhat familiar with it: He passed it every day on his way to work, and it was always busy around his time of evening, even on weeknights. Part of him always wanted to go inside and be a part of the scene, but he never did. \n\nThe man in sunglasses - his name was Joe - led Dom toward the club, and even before Joe spoke, Dom somehow knew that it was their destination. \u201cThere,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go around back.\u201d\n\nDom and Joe had been walking for what seemed like an hour but couldn\u2019t have been more than fifteen minutes. Dom stuck as close to Joe as possible as if for protection, and had become accustomed to his pungent smell. It was noticeable only at extremely close range, part sickly sweet and part\u2026something else, something Dom could not place but still somehow recognized. They were two blocks from the club, maybe three, and Dom could hear the pulsing techo/house/whatever music as clearly as if he were standing in the middle of the dancefloor. He could hear the chatter of the people inside, or at least he imagined he could. He could smell them too: Beneath the odors of perfume, desperation, and spiritual rot was something richer, something blissful. Dom realized for the first time that he was parched - so parched - and drool filled his mouth.\n\nA crowd of people waited outside Club Vlad, talking and laughing; some vaped, some stared down at their cellphones like Gollum with his precious ring. Dom\u2019s first reaction was to avoid them. Perhaps sensing this\u2026or perhaps feeling it himself\u2026Joe ducked into an alleyway two doors down from the club. \u201cWe\u2019ll go in the back,\u201d Joe explained. \n\nThe back entrance to Club Vlad was a single door underneath a bare bulb. The music was so loud that Dom\u2019s head began to throb. Inside, a dark hallway terminated in an archway filled with throbbing white light. Dread filled Dom as they approached it - he didn\u2019t want to be around people - but thankfully they went into a room off the hall instead. An office. A cramped desk, a filing cabinet. A set of stairs disappeared into shadows. \n\n\u201cSit,\u201d Joe said.\n\nDom obeyed, sitting in the swivel chair. \n\nJoe went up the stairs and Dom was alone. The deep coldness that had long settled into his bones made itself known again, and Dom leaned forward, wrapping his arms around his chest for warmth. The muffled music vibrated in his skull, setting his teeth on edge, and the various smells wafting in from the main room assaulted his senses. He was alternately repulsed and aroused by the crashing din of scents: The good, the bad, and the mouth watering. A sharp pain cut through his stomach like the killing edge of a knife, and Dom hugged himself tighter. Had his throat always been this dry? His throat felt like sandpaper; his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth and getting it unstuck hurt so badly that tears sprang to his eyes. \n\nDom rubbed his arms with his hands and tried to still his chattering teeth. He looked around for a blanket, a discarded jacket, something to cover himself with, but there was nothing. Only drifts of glitter on the floor and walls. He supposed it came from a party or something. He\u2019d never been to a night club but it seemed fitting.\n\nA sound drew his attention to the door leading back into the hall. A woman - no older than a girl - stood there, looking confused and unsteady. She was dressed in black, wore glow sticks around her wrists and neck, and held a red solo cup. \u201cI have to pee,\u201d she said drunkenly and laughed. \u201cI thought this was the bathroom.\u201d\n\nA cold wind washed over Dom, and Joe was standing next to him. \u201cThe bathroom\u2019s up here,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d the girl laughed, \u201cI thought it was here but I didn\u2019t know. This is my first time here.\u201d She held her cup aloft. \u201cTake me to it.\u201d\n\nJoe glanced at Dom. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nThey formed a party as they climbed the stairs, Dom in the tear and Joe at the head. The girl stumbled and held onto the railing, talking incessantly. Her voice hurt Dom\u2019s head, but the hot smell wafting from her was intoxicating. Drool coursed down his chin and his breathing came in short, hot bursts. Another sharp pain rent his stomach, and he winced.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, where the lights were cold and white, a woman in black stood by a doorway, her back ramrod straight and her eyes vacant. Her face was gaunt, her white flesh pulled tight across her skull. She wore a black dress and her black hair long and straight. Dom only caught a glance at her before looking away again.\n\nShe looked like a ghost.\n\n\u201cShow her the bathroom,\u201d Joe said. \n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes slowly, ponderles, went from Joe to the drunk girl. Her expression, like Joe\u2019s, was dead. She *had* no expression. \u201cThis way.\u201d\n\nShe and the drunk girl disappeared down the hall, and Joe led Dom into a room. Though it was pitch black, Dom could still see; not very well\u2026but he could see. Suddenly, a blinding white light flicked on in front of him, causing him to stop and fall back a step. Ahead, through an archway, sat a vaulted chamber, at the center of which sat a man. To Dom\u2019s light dazzled eyes, he seemed a proud king perched upon a throne, the skulls of his many enemies piled around him. Dom blinked and turned his head slightly to the side. His eyes began to adjust, and the world came into focus. \n\nThe man was not, as it had first seemed, sitting on a throne. Instead, he was esconded in a motorized wheelchair. The piles of skulls were actually various pieces of machinery, the kind you\u2019d find in a hospital room. A clear tube extended from one of them to the side of the man\u2019s neck: Yellow liquid flowed from the machine and into the man. Another tube, this one in the other side of his neck, filtered out a mixture of what looked like yellow pus and black sludge. An infected malodor filled the air, and the machines whirred softly as they worked. \n\nAs for the man himself, his appearance was normal at first glance, Dressed in a flowing red velvet robe, a blue and green blanket with a plaid pattern draped over his shoulders, he was portly, about fifty, and had shoulder length grayish hair with a bald spot in the middle. If the local theater put on a production of *Hamilton*, they could cast a worse Ben Franklin than him. \n\nOn closer inspection, he was not normal at all. His complexion was yellow and waxy, like a statue, and his body was lumpy, misshapen, resembling an overfilled trash bag stuffed with cotton. His eyes were sick and yellow, and something about his posture seemed\u2026off. It didn\u2019t make sense, but the only thing Dom could think was: *He looks impossible*. \n\nJoe stopped at the edge of the shadows, where the line between light and darkness lay. He seemed to stand up a little straighter, a general greeting his king. \u201cHere he is,\u201d Joe said.\n\nThe man squinted slightly against the glare of the light and motioned with one gnarled hand. \u201cStep into the light,\u201d he said. His voice was soft and kind, that of a senile though loving grandmother. Dom imagined he felt a pull toward the man, and did as he was bidden, wincing as the light stung his eyes. \n\nFor a moment, the man stared at him, his waxen features frozen fast as stone. Then, a subtle look of compassion flickered across his face. Dom did not believe in God, but he suddenly felt like a man standing before God, his every thought, feeling, and transgression laid bare. He had never felt so naked in his life, so exposed. He had the sense that the man before him could see everything, knew everything. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d the man said. It was not a question, but a statement. \n\nEverything Dom had been through over the past couple of days came back to him in a rush, and hot tears filled his eyes. He nodded. \n\nThe man nodded slightly, more to himself than to Dom. \u201cKneel down,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to look at you.\u201d\n\nDom knelt without question.\n\nThe man lifted one hand and touched Dom\u2019s face, tilting Dom\u2019s head from one side to the other like a farmer appraising a horse. His fingers were long and bony, his nails ragged and unkempt; his touch was like ice. He brushed his knuckles over the purple bruise on Dom\u2019s cheek, and there was such gentleness in that one act that Dom broke down sobbing. He leaned into the man\u2019s touch like a cat and gave voice to his misery. \n\n\u201cShhh,\u201d the man said, \u201cit\u2019s all over now.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-What\u2019s happening to me?\u201d Dom asked.\n\nIn his heart of hearts, however, he already knew.\n\n\u201cYou died,\u201d the man said patiently. \u201cAnd you came back.\u201d\n\nHearing it stated so plainly, Dom cried even harder. \n\n\u201cOnly a handful of people throughout history can claim to have defeated death,\u201d the man said, stroking Dom\u2019s hair, \u201cand you\u2019re one of them. You should be proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Dom asked between sobs. \u201cWhat am I?\u201d\n\nThe man stroked Dom\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the same thing I am.\u201d\n\nAt that, Dom looked up at the man. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d he asked.\n\nA little, knowing smile touched the man\u2019s lips, and when he spoke, his canine teeth were longer and sharper than before. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dom moaned and shook his head, \u201cno, no, no.\u201d He grabbed the man\u2019s hand and held tight, his tears coming faster. He trembled like a frightened animal and squeezed his eyes closed, as if by doing so he could escape the hell his life had become.\n\nBut there was no escape. \n\n\u201cYou have a lot of questions,\u201d the man said, monologuing now rather than speaking directly to Dom, \u201cI had the same questions when I was your age. I have spent the last forty-two years of my life trying to answer them, but every answer I find leads me to still more questions. There\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of, though.\u201d\n\nDom blinked the tears from his eyes. The last of them had been squeezed from his dead tear ducts and he had no more to give. He simply stared into space, trying to come to grips with his situation.\n\n\u201cThere is freedom in death,\u201d the man said. \u201cDeath is easy. It\u2019s simple. Once it\u2019s over, you feel no pain, no sadness, no grief. It\u2019s living that\u2019s hard.\u201d \n\nAs he spoke, he brushed his long nails across Dom\u2019s scalp. It was a soothing feeling, and served to calm him. \u201cPeople have so many *troubles*.\u201d A note of revulsion crept into his voice. \u201cSo many needs, so many desires. People are complex but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re easy to please. A vampire wants only two things: A little blood and one more night.\u201d \n\nThe combination of his touch and his voice had pacified Dom to the point of almost tranquility. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Dom heard himself mumble. \n\nNodding almost reluctantly, the man said, \u201cFear is one of the only emotions a vampire can\u2019t escape. Everything feels fear. Do you want to know a secret?\u201d\n\nDom nodded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid too,\u201d the man confessed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of death. Well\u2026death as it were. I\u2019m terrified that my body will rot away and leave me a pile of bones somewhere, unable to move but still aware\u201d \n\nA shudder went through Dom. \n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen yourself, the movies lied. We rot just like any other dead thing. Our flesh decays, our organs turn to sludge, and we go from rational men to monsters whose only thought is feeding.\u201d\n\nNow it was his turn to shiver. \n\n\u201cBut\u2026you\u2019re not like that,: Dom said.\u2019\n\nThe man smiled. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, I guess\u201d A thin yellow fluid began to drip from his nostrils. He did not seem to notice. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cDominick,\u201d Dom said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Merrick,\u201d the man said, \u201cand this is my family.\u201d  \n\n\nDom realized that they were now surrounded by others, ten in all. They stood ramrod straight, their eyes vacant and their faces devoid of humanity. They were mainly men, though one was a woman. Some were pale, others were blue or black, and one was little more than a skeleton clad in withered brown skin, a white button up and jeans hanging from its frame. \n\nA thought occurred to Dom. \u201cYou said my brain was going to rot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Merrick cautioned, \u201cthough it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to be\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike them?\u201d Merrick asked. \u201cBraindead and staring?\u201d\n\nSheepishly, Dom nodded.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Merrick allowed. \u201cBut these people are free of everything that troubles humanity. You were human just a short time ago. I\u2019m sure you remember all too well what it was like. The constant politics, the moral quandaries, the philosophical pontificating. Human beings - and make no mistake, we are humans - were not meant for all of that. We\u2019re animals. We were made to hunt, fuck, and sleep. Somewhere along the way, we got pretentious and started complicating things.\u201d He looked at Dom, sizing him up, seeming to read him. \u201cThings that animals take for granted, people work their entire lives to achieve. If an animal wants to fornicate, it fornicates. If a man wants to fornicate, he needs to be tall, handsome, rich, funny, progressive when it suits women but traditional when it doesn\u2019t. If a man wants a home, he has to work thirty years for it. An animal has only to dig a hole in the ground.\u201d\n\nEvery word struck a chord with Dom.\n\nBecause every word was true. \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the living won\u2019t allow us to live that freely, so we have to hide. These people here - my children - need a guiding hand, a protector, someone who can lead them. And I, an old man, need help.\u201d Here he smiled playfully and patted his bulging stomach. \u201cMy body is mostly sawdust and cotton balls at this point, so I can\u2019t do much. I share my wisdom and my knowledge with them, and they take care of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you\u2026rotted?\u201d Dom asked.\n\n\u201cEmbalming fluid,\u201d Merrick said. \u201cBlood doesn\u2019t sustain you. Embalming fluid does.\u201d He smiled at Dom. \u201cIt can sustain you as well. If you\u2019ll stay with us. We\u2019re not the most attractive bunch, but we\u2019re a family, and we really wish you\u2019d join us.\u201d\n\nA family.\n\nDom\u2019s parents had broken up and he lived with his mother. He had never had a family before, and had always wanted one, a real one, like in the movies. Even as a grown man, he sought the love, acceptance, and belonging that a family brings. He sought it in the wrong ways, but that - and not sex, not romantic love - is what he had really wanted all along. \n\nThis is what he had wanted all along. \n\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Dom said.\n\nWorking quickly, Merrick slashed his wrist open with his thumbnail. An ugly mixture of stale blood, siphoned from someone else, and embalming fluid leaked out. \u201cIf you choose to drink, my blood will be in you. You will be my son and I will be your father. You will obey me as your father. You will do whatever is asked of you for this family, as this family will do for you. You will not reveal the secrets of this family to anyone outside of it. You will protect this family from all threats, both inside and out. Do you accept?\u201d\n\nHe held his bleeding wrist out to Dom.\n\nDom did not question, nor did he hesitate. He grabbed the hand of his father, brought it to his mouth, and drank from the seeping wound. The fluid was cold, thick, and vile.\n\nIt tasted like belonging. \n\n\u201cHave you fed yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dom said.\n\n\u201cBefore you do, I have a question for you. Who did this to you? Who made you?\u201d\n\nDom thought. Everything was hazy.   \n\u201cWas it someone in this room?\u201d Merrick asked.\n\nDom shook his head. \u201cHer name is\u2026\u201d he wracked his brain. \u201cHeather.\u201d\n\nMerrick nodded. \u201cSo there\u2019s another out there.\u201d He looked at Joe. \u201cDid you turn her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Joe said.\n\nMerrick looked annoyed. \u201cI\u2019ve told you not to go out and feed on your own. You have no self-control. You drink too much and create others, which creates headaches for the family. Tomorrow night, I want you and Dom to find her and bring her here.\u201d  \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Joe said.\n\nMerrick looked over Dom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJess? Can you come here?\u201d\n\nThe black haired woman from earlier came out of the shadows, the drunk girl with her, arms tied behind her back. The girl looked dazed. \u201cMax,\u201d Merrick said to the skeletal corpse-thing, \u201chelp her.\u201d\n\nMax, Jessie, and another vampire named Matt tied chains around the girl\u2019s ankles and hoisted her aloft via a pulley system. Upside down, she swung back and forth. Merrick instructed the others to leave the room. \u201cMax,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his way out, the corpse-thing produced a knife and dragged it across the girl\u2019s throat, slicing her skin; blood spurted out. Max leaned in to taste it, but Merrick shooed him away. When he and Dom were alone, Merrick told Dom, \u201cGo to her.\u201d\n\nBut Dom was already on his feet, his eyes transfixed by the crimson life flowing from her pumping throat. The hot, rich smell filled his nostrils and tantalized his senses. Saliva filled his mouth and his stomach panged with hunger. Some small, human part of his decaying brain screamed at him to stop, but he did not listen to it. He had been human for almost thirty years, and he had been miserable. Now, in this chamber of the undead, he gave himself over to his dark thirst. Like a man in a dream, he shuffled to her, inhaled the sweet scent of her blood, and shivered. He was so lost in lust that he hardly noticed the strange, cumbersome feeling of his descended fangs. \n\n\u201cDrink,\u201d Merrick said.\n\nOpening his mouth wide, Dom sank his teeth into the girl\u2019s neck. Her blood filled his mouth and splashed down his throat. Warmth thawed the ice in his marrow and spread through him. His dead heart began to flutter, then to pound. His knees shook, his body trembled, and his mind rolled away on a tide of ecstasy. \n\nAs it was his first meal, he couldn\u2019t drink much. Before long, his stomach was hard and distended and his body burned with fire. He collapsed to a heap on the floor and twitched as random nerve endings, stimulated by the blood, began to misfire. He felt full, warm, and drunk. He closed his eyes and let himself drift. \n\nDominick Mason had died. \n\nAnd this\u2026\n\nThis was heaven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith all that was happening in the city of Albany, the last thing Bruce Kenner needed on Thursday morning was a visit from Bertha the bitch, but that\u2019s exactly what he got. She flew into his office like she owned the place and instantly started in on him. Young man this and have you talked to Joe Rossi that. You\u2019d think she was his boss. And if she were his boss, he\u2019d quit and find another line of work. He heard McDonald\u2019s was hiring.\n\nBruce almost snapped at her. He\u2019d been up most of last night riding around Albany and looking for Dominick Mason. He and Vanessa expected him to drop dead somewhere close to the medical examiner\u2019s office, but if he had, he\u2019d done so in a super secret location. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to go by his place of work today.\u201d\n\nTired and still confused over that bullshit from last night, he had no energy to argue with the old crone. He could spare a few minutes to talk to Joe Rossi, he figured. He assumed that Jessie was safe but he owed it to her to check. If he found the girl, he\u2019d take her back to her grandmother (sorry, kid, really) and try to avoid arresting the guy. Unless he came off as a creep, then he\u2019d bust his ass. See, people assumed that an older guy with a younger girlfriend was some master manipulator hell bent on evil deeds. Sometimes they were, but hell, his grandparents married when his grandpa was twenty-one and his grandma sixteen. They were married for fifty-five years and loved each other to the end. Maybe it was innocent, maybe not. It wasn\u2019t his job to judge either way. Just gimme the girl so I can get her grandma off my back and no one gets hurt. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you started doing your job,\u201d Bertha said, \u201cI heard on the police scanner last night that you people lost a body. What kind of town is this? Your coroner is a drunk who makes up stories about bodies walking away. He probably sold it to black people.\u201d\n\nBruce couldn\u2019t help it; he snorted laughter.\n\n\u201cNow what would black people want with a dead body?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably to use it as a prop in one of their rap videos.\u201d\n\nBruce didn\u2019t know much about music videos, but he was pretty sure that the people who made them didn\u2019t like the smell of corpse any more than the rest of us. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to round up all the local rappers for questioning. Is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d\n\nLuckily for him, there was not, and Bertha left shortly thereafter. Alone and able to hear himself think, Bruce sat back in his chair and went over his mental checklist for the day. First order of business, go to Club Vlad. Second, find Dominick Mason. There were others, but that was the most important. He wanted the body found so someone could get to work explaining this whole weird thing. There had to be an explanation. The thought that there wasn\u2019t, that a dead guy literally rose from the grave and disappeared into the night, deeply disturbed Bruce, and the more this whole thing remained ongoing, the more disturbed he would become.\n\nNeeding some fresh air, he decided to hit up Club Vlad. \n\nOutside, the day was hot and sunny. Waves of heat shimmered from the pavement and not a single breath of air stirred in the whole world. Bruce slipped on a pair of sunglasses and drove over to Club Vlad. It occurred to him that the place might be closed during the day; it was the only place Joe Rossi was associated with. His address in the computer system was Glens Falls, far to the north. The messages he sent Jessie indicated that he lived onsite at Club Vlad. \n\nThe build, wedged between a corner store and a check cashing place, was as grimy and dumpy looking as it had always been. The front windows were blacked out and covered with posters and fliers for punk concerts, house bands, and far left political organizations: The Albany Social Justice Center, something called Bash the Fash 2025, and Bruce\u2019s favorite. ACAB. He caught some kid spraying that on the side of the police station once, and under extreme police torture (ie, a good tongue lashing), the kid told him it meant All Cops Are Barnacleheads. \n\nBruce shot the kid on the spot and planted a gun on him. \n\nHow's that for barnaclehead?\n\nCalm down, he didn\u2019t really do that. He made him clean the graffiti off with a toothbrush. LOL he was out there for hours. \n\nThe sidewalk in front of the former theater was empty save for some little. The box office was abandoned. There was no open sigh, but then again, there was no closed sign either. He parked his cruiser at the curb, killed the engine, and got out, sweat instantly springing to his brow. \n\nTo his surprise, the door opened. Inside, a couple steps led down to a dance floor. A bar lined the wall to his right, and a couple more sets led up to a railed platform filled with tables. Above, a huge balcony looked down on him. A giant disco ball hung from the ceiling like a pair of glittery nuts and there were cages here and there. Presumably where girls danced go-go style. Oh yeah, nothing hotter than a woman behind bars. Why do you think Bruce became a cop in the first place? \n\nSpeaking of glittery nuts, there was glitter everywhere. On the floor, on the tables, on the bar. It twinkled like flecks of diamond and swirled around your feet when you walked. Bruce imagined big buckets of the stuff raining down on the dance floor at midnight and he shuddered. Imagine having glitter stuck in your hair. That shit would never come out.\n\nMusic played from the sound system, not as loud as it would be during operating hours. It sounded like \u201880s metal, not exactly what he expected from a place like this.\n\n*Some say life she's a lady*\n\n*Kinda soft, kinda shady*\n\n*I can tell you life is rich*\n\n*She's no lady, she's a bitch*\n\nBeing morning, the place was deserted except for a man behind the bar, busy at cleaning the countertop in anticipation for the night\u2019s events. He was tall, Hispanic or Italian, and feminine, with a single earring and a tank top. \n\nBruce moseyed over to the bar and the barkeep looked up, missing a beat when he realized the fuzz was here. He sat down his rag and walked over. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked in a whispy voice.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Joe Rossi. Is he here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the bartender said. He looked nervous. \u201cI can check.\u201d\n\nBefore Bruce could answer, he scurried off, leaving him alone. \n\n*They suck my body out*\n\n*But friend there is no doubt*\n\n*I'm gonna pay the devil his dues*\n\n*Cause I'm sick of being abused*\n\nBruce looked around, his fingers absently drumming on the countertop. Club Vlad was a clashing mix of grunge and glam that made his head hurt. He imagined what the place must be like at midnight, packed and noisy, and nodded to himself. Yeah, this was the spot, he guessed, the place all the cool kids went, if they went anywhere anymore. Hell, if he was thirty years younger, he might come here. \n\nHe had been waiting for almost twenty minutes when a voice spoke behind him. He turned with a start, and beheld the strangest man he had ever seen in his life. Short and plump - lumpy, even - he sat in a wheelchair, a red blanket draped over his shoulders and his hands resting on his knees. He was about fifty with sparse gray hair falling to his shoulders and a plastic-looking face. He looked like a wax statue of Ben Franklin come to life, and a deep sense of disquiet stirred in the pit of Bruce\u2019s stomach.\n\n*Just can't fight the temptation*\n\n*It's become my inspiration*\n\n*Gonna get myself an axe*\n\n*Break some heads, break some backs*\n\nIt was only then that Bruce noticed the sickly sweet smell of death.\n\nIt seemed to come from the man in waves.  \n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you,\u201d the man said, \u201cmy name is Merrick Garvis and I own Club Vlad. Maybe I can be of assistance.\u201d\n\nBruce grew up in the south where manners and saving face were paramount. His mother and his grandmother both taught him that it was impolite to stare. Maybe he'd been in New York so long that he\u2019d forgotten himself, or maybe Merrick Garvis was just the strangest looking man in the world. Either way, Bruce couldn\u2019t help gaping at his strange appearance. Recovering, he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I -\u201d\n\nMerrick smiled and waved one hand. Why was it so goddamn skeletal? \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I was injured in a fire a long time ago and this is the best they could do for me. To be honest, I\u2019d stare too. What can I help you with, officer?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Joe Rossi,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI understand he works for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Merrick said, \u201cbut I had to let him go. Did he do something wrong?\u201d\n\nBruce sighed. \u201cWell, yeah, he\u2019s shacked up with a sixteen year old runaway.\u201d\n\nA look of concern crossed Merrick\u2019s features, such as they were. \u201cOh, my, that is concerning. I haven\u2019t seen him in several days. I assume he went home. He lives in Glens Falls.\u201d\n\nBruce nodded, his mind working. If Rossi really was in Glens Falls, that meant the whole mess was someone else\u2019s problem. He could send Bertha up there to bother some other poor barnacle head and be rid of her. Yet\u2026he didn\u2019t think Rossi *was* in Glens Falls. Bruce had a knack for knowing when people were lying, and he was certain that Merrick Garvis was doing just that. It couldn\u2019t be a facial tick, as his features were largely unmoving, like clay. Maybe it was something in his cloudy eyes. Maybe it was the tone of his voice. Or maybe Bruce had the shining and knew things just for the hell of it. In any event, the certainty that Merrick Garvis was lying grew stronger with each passing second.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you fire him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got drunk and hit one of the customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Bruce asked. \u201cWhat was his position?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a bouncer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t bouncers supposed to hit people?\u201d\n\nMerrick fumbled. \u201cWell\u2026not to punch them in the face for bumping into them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long did he work for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix months.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever see him with an underage girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Merrick said, \u201cyou have to be twenty-one to get in. I make sure everyone\u2019s ID is checked at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if she had a fake ID?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I guess she\u2019d get in, but I\u2019d assume she was of legal age.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said he shoved someone, when did this happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast week,\u201d Merrick said.\n\n\u201cI thought you said he hit someone.\u201d\n\nMerrick again fumbled. \u201cI did.\u201d Now his face seemed to darken a little. A strange yellowish liquid, too thin to be snot, began to drip from his nostrils. Bruce barely suppressed a smear of disgust. \u201cI understand you have a job to do but playing mind games with me isn\u2019t going to solve anything. I can give you his address. Other than that, I can\u2019t help you further.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to see your ID please.\u201d\n\nMerrick glared at him. \u201cI suppose you want my name, rank, and serial number as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, yeah, I\u2019d love that.\u201d\n\nMerrick drew a deep sigh. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nIn five minutes, Bruce had Merrick\u2019s ID, social, and all other relevant information. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t have bothered, even though he was well within his rights to ask for this information from someone he was questioning. But something about Merrick Garvis was off, and not just his weird face or strangely bulbous body. Bruce was just smart enough to realize that something was going on here, but not quite smart enough to even begin to imagine what. \n\nWhen he had everything he needed and saw no reason to stick around, Bruce bid Merrick farewell and left the club. Before he could do anything else, he got a call from dispatch: Officer needed assistance in Pine Hills. Bruce slipped behind the wheel and went forth to help, momentarily putting Merrick Garvis out of his mind.\n\nBut soon or later, he would get back to him.\n\nOh yes he would.",

And **(+)** means it's their most streamed song overall. Songs with over 100M or 10M streams will be rounded to the nearest million. Songs with over a billion streams will be rounded to the nearest hundred million. And songs with less than 10M streams will be rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.

        "selftext": "I'm just an average guy. I want love. Someone supportive of my challenges, fears, anxieties and I'd be the same for you. Someone accepting of my flaws which I can't easily change about myself. And I will have full acceptance and empathy towards your imperfections too. Let's improve ourselves together.\n\nI want to talk. It gives me hope, happiness, dispels away my loneliness. I want to develop that connection and bond. Eventually, though, I'd like a relationship, if it's possible. I understand everyone has requirements or things they look for in a partner and no one should compromise on their expectations. And that's fine totally.\n\nIf you are someone who enjoys conversations and the process of getting to know each other and have plenty of time like me, then do hit me up for a chat and let's start slowly. \n\nOtherwise, if you are someone who is usually running busy, then just ask me for the list of  shortcomings I may  have or summary of essential facts about me. I'll try my best to save your time from getting wasted in futile conversations. Or alternatively, just send me an elaborate list of the traits, qualities, and aspects you are seeking in a potential partner and I'll let you know if I can / can't meet them. \n\nYou can be from anywhere. So get to know me, hopefully for long term relationship \u263a\ufe0f\ud83c\udf39\n\nIm searching, somewhere in universe, a soul connection with honesty and compatibility. \n\nIm tall 6'0 okayish looking Indian guy, not successful in career but have enough to support himself. I'm open to LDR and looking for true love. So, you can be from any country. We will be with each other in real someday. \n\nMy personality is deep and I'm keen to know what's yours like in depth. I want you to be expressive about your issues, feelings, things concerning you, things u wish for. I am childfree. \n\n>My views on relationships :\n\n\nLoving is different from being in a relationship. And being in a relationship is not always being in love.\n\n\nIt's possible that 2 people love each other deeply, but aren't in a relationship for reasons such as incompatibility , feasibility. The inverse is also possible, that 2 people enter into a relationship , out of sheer convenience, co-incidence, circumstances or compatibility but are not actually in love.\n\n\nLove is acceptance, when we accept the person with all his flaws for who he is , and when we in turn are confident that we'd be accepted and loved too and hence don't have to adopt a fake appearance or try to show us as someone we are not, to get acceptance. But it also involves us putting a serious effort to fix our shortcomings and improve ourselves so that we become even more suitable for our partner. We consider ourselves as a 'present' we are giving to our partner and want to give them the best version of ourselves.\n\n\nAlso love is when we care about others as much as ourselves and do everything possible, making self-sacrifices to prevent them from getting hurt even if it affects/compromises our own interests.\n\n\nRelationships aren't about finding the best we can get, it's about finding the best person for us. A person who may not be as handsome, successful, smart etc but who'll stick with you is actually more valuable than an unreliable disloyal alpha man who frequently gives you insecurities and has potential to be infidel\n\nMy field of work involves trading , investment and analyzing data . I was a programmer in past. In future , I'm planning to start a retail outlet as a side business. Although I have a comfortable existence, I still haven't achieved any breakthrough yet in career. I'm sort of struggling . So , only accept me if you are willing to travel a rough road together.",

Saying I was making things about myself all the time and overall hated me. She used to call me nicknames I was uncomfortable with that her continued calling me despite me saying how uncomfortable I was, claiming they said it because they loved me. \n\nThey treated me as if I meant nothing to them and constantly put me down every time I wanted to talk to them.

They began to purposely ignore me and Luna was telling them that I cheated on her and that I was manipulative. The only person on my side was Vi as I fell into a deep depression for 4 months. I tried to keep us all together even if they didn\u2019t want to.\n\nI pretended to be my old self before all of this, trying to be as kind as possible so they would trust me more so that I could convince them to give me a chance. That\u2019s when I figured out they all kept in contact without me and Vi.

Eventually Luna drove Li to attempt, and that\u2019s what caused them to leave me.\n\nThey all blamed Li for ruining our friend group for leaving first and Luna began calling Li a manipulator too.

        "selftext": "Okay, so the following analogy isn't a knock on religious people. I was just raised religious and so it makes the most sense to me as a metaphor. It is not why I'm sad, and I'm not criticizing the belief system.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI grew up being told that God answers prayers. The particular religion I was raised in was very specific about certain \"promises\" that God would answer prayers. If I prayed to know a certain thing was true, then God would answer that prayer confirming it. If I prayed to know if I should do a certain thing, or believe a certain person, or trust a certain book, then God would answer that prayer. It was a simple certainty. It was a promise with no exceptions or conditions.\n\nNow, I hope you can see where I'm going. If a person prayed to know if a certain thing was true, and they reported that they got no answer, they were always met with bewilderment. Like a cog in their religious leader's head just stopped turning. Such a thing was unthinkable. God answers prayers. For someone to not get an answer... unimaginable.\n\nSo, they were usually told they had prayed incorrectly. Or they should try again. Wait a little longer. You can guess the suggestions. But the point is that it just was... impossible... that it wouldn't work.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOkay, so... I'm struggling right now. I'm on day 2 of essentially a nonstop panic attack, but that is the short term. I've been very distressed and in a constant state of fear and pain for several years now. Only for the last few days have I been completely unable to function. I know that all sounds very dramatic, and I'm really sorry, but it feels very real and I'm not sure what else to call it.\n\nI've tried everything that I am supposed to try. I'm honestly trying to not just roll over and give up. I'm not giving up quickly or concluding I'm helpless. I'm just so sorry that I cannot find what to do. \n\n\\> I've tried to be positive and think of what I'm grateful for (and I am for a great deal!), and\n\n\\> I've tried to think of what I can change to be better. To fix what is wrong.\n\n\\* I've tried to \"fake it till I make it\" and smile to fool my body into thinking I'm okay, and\n\n\\* I've tried to embrace the pain and \"feel my feelings\".\n\n\\~ I've tried to distract myself, and\n\n\\~ I've tried to face it head on and think long and hard about it.\n\n\\- I've talked to loved ones I trust, and\n\n\\- I'm trying to talk to strangers I don't know (right now, in fact).\n\n\\+ I've tried deep breathing, counting things I can see, the things I can hear, or smell, or trying to feel my toes or be aware of my elbows or whatever grounding strategies you sometimes hear.\n\n\\+ I tried reaching our for therapy and medication and professional help.\n\nI swear, I promise, I'm doing all of the things that I'm supposed to do, and none of it is working. I can't hang on any more. Everything, mentally and more recently physically, hurts so much that I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm so sorry. I feel like my old religious leaders.\n\nI'm so sorry. I've tried everything that I've been taught you are supposed to do when you are panicked. When you are so depressed that you hope to get in a fatal wreck every time you step in a vehicle. I'm staring at myself with bewilderment completely unable to process what I'm supposed to do now. **I did all of the things. It still hurts so much that I cannot focus on anything else. I feel like I have to do something, anything because I cannot stay here. But I'm in a room with no doors or windows and I cannot leave.** \n\nI'm so sorry, I don't even know what I'm expecting here from you good people out there, but I don't know what to do besides just say what I'm thinking out loud. I'm tired of going to bed and hoping to have a cardiac event or aneurysm in the night. Is this really just the moment when you realize there is nothing left and you check out?",

I feel I can never be good enough for Him, in all honesty. I can\u2019t feel His love. I can be selfish, and lazy. Pessimistic and suicidal. I vape weed. I\u2019ve done some bad things in life. I feel too flawed and messy for God. I struggle with depression and anxiety, which makes it hard for me to hold on to any faith. In fact, I might not have faith at all, and that worries me. I feel like God must be disappointed in me. I wish I could be perfect for Him, but I can\u2019t. I want to obey Him, but don\u2019t know how. I hate myself, and that might be the biggest problem of all. I\u2019m seeing a therapist, and taking medication, but I\u2019m still unhappy. I guess I expected God to make me happy, since that\u2019s usually what other Christians say. To just focus on God and Jesus, and give your troubles to them. That only following Jesus is the answer to everything. But no matter how many hymns I hear, or pages of the Bible I read, I don\u2019t feel much of anything. I don\u2019t want my relationship with God/Jesus to be based on what I can get from them, as that seems selfish and fake. I want a real relationship, but I feel like I\u2019m the problem in the equation. God always feels far away. I keep telling Him how sorry I am in my writings to Him, and I wonder if He hears it. \n\nSpeaking of apologies, I apologize for the rant. I\u2019m just feeling quite lost and sad at the moment. But thank you for reading if you did. \n\nAny advice? ",

But God's love works very differently - otherwise there would not be one human being 'qualifying' for his love - which is, in any case, very different from 'affection'.  The heart of the Gospel is that 'while we were yet sinners' God entered the world in the person of Jesus, and demonstrated his love to such an extent that he was willing to die for us.\n\nHis love is not conditional on how we behave, how many times we fall short of what we feel his standards for us are - and if we are struggling with self-esteem, depression, anxiety etc., he totally understands what a massive barrier that can be to living up to even our own standards, never mind those of a Holy God. But He doesn't count what we may see as our failures against us, and will forgive us 'seventy times seven' times (and more if necessary) so long as our hearts are inclined to try and please Him. At the end of the days none of us will ever live perfect lives, but God loves us anyway.",

                "body": "Hey you. You don't need to feel fake for not following culture or rituals like the 100% people do. You don't have to feel rejected by Christ for your lesser sins - I mean he went to the cross to take our sins from us, if we had none, he wouldn't have had to do it, right?\n\nIt's all good, maybe one tip, instead of trying to give yourself that outer appearance from a Christian by following a culture, why not try to live out the faith a little more in practice, so you can can get refreshed by the fruit that this can bring to you?\n\nIt's not so much about the worship, singing and reading. That will help making your faith firm. It will remind you of what you believe in, and the Word of God that is everywhere. It can cleanse you by pushing all dirt away for a while.\n\nRemember what Christ taught so he could take your sins away was to follow his Word and take his advice and strive to do as he taught. And he did not teach a lot about worship and singing, he taught about loving the neighbor, striving to be humble and to avoid what is wasteful, evil or criminal. He taught about how it is better when people use their gifts for doing good and when they help each other getting by in our hard world.\n\nSo this is where I find my real faith comes from: from dealing with people or doing my thing and building up my projects in a way I believe God would want me to do. The worship, singing, prayer will make you stronger for it, but alone they wouldn't do much like you see. Try to find some people to talk and do something with, doesn't even have to be Christians, just find people to talk about or do good things with that you think are worthy of God and what Jesus taught us to do. Or when people aren't your thing, try to find a thing to help with, pursue and build bit by bit that is to honor and glory of God, helping others in pain in his name or spreading his Word, even try to find others to help or inspire you.\n\nPray for Christ to be with you and give you the strength and vision to do these things well. I believe then he can be with us, and can help us doing what would be hard for us otherwise - he would do with us what is worthy of his name, so he would ofc only help doing righteous works this way. Seek, and you will find, try, and you will see. It is the living faith, that will bring us closer to God. It is discussing and utilizing the faith with others, which will make it stronger with time to push us through all doubts. The living faith, where works and deeds and words are done and said that bring life, these are what will bring us closer to God and Christ as it is fulfilling what they are asking from us and what they are ready to help us with and reward us for.\n\nSo take it slow, but maybe consider, if it's maybe time to make some steps and try to live out faith a little more actively, not just by worship or study. It's not always people that bring us forward, sometimes it's a task or change in life, or a struggle we find us in and that we decide not to give up against but to grow stronger from. Think sin is not your little menial sins, but Christ is more serious about the things that truly hurt people. But Christ himself drank wine and laughed and ate with people, and probably also danced, when he was not busy bringing those who were bound to more serious troubles the message and relief they were looking for. Nonetheless think if it would be better to take care that you don't pollute your body and mind too much. So if you think you lack too much energy, apart from medical help and counseling you should evaluate your lifestyle and try to change or cut short things that are interfering with your aspirations for a life in God. Think of how healthy you keep your body and mind in terms of healthy eating, enough regeneration, but also treating your mind carefully, not overloading it with too much information and allowing yourself enough rest and edifying entertainment that brings you true knowledge about the world instead of encouraging sins or showing distorted realities. All these things together can help you grow more alive and healthy and sane about it all, and also to gain more faith. Just work it out what drags you down the most, then how to overcome and how to get assistance when it's too heavy on you.\n\nBut remember you don't have to be perfect, you're a beautiful soul with and also because of all your special traits, gifts, abilities, but also burdens and shortcomings that each of us must have in our world. They're part of our lives, and are often glorified in the end together with the person who managed to gain a good life with it. Try to remember that Christ is not about you becoming like him...it is about you being free to live in a good and righteous way, so at the moment when it counts, you will be ready for him to inspire you what he needs you to do, and it is the love that we need to practice the most, as this is all he requires us to be ready for, if we want to join him in the holiness that God could give us through him. Remember also it's his help that will bring you there, and a way where you need to practice this virtue many times. The songs and worship - will make you stronger for this, but they are all about his virtue, they are not just the virtue in itself!",

Billions and it doesn\u2019t really matter where you point your thumb, there will be billions and billions of galaxies. We can now go and watch stars and galaxies being formed, we can see what the creation of our planet was like when God spun it together. There\u2019s vast infinity out there and yet the creator of that infinity sent a message to us that they loved us and all we really need to do is love him and love each other.

All you need to do to \u201cbe a Christian\u201d is 1) believe Jesus is the son of God 2) believe Jesus died for our sins\nMost of the rules are just man\u2019s opinion on what a \u201cChristian\u201d should do. I used to feel the way you do and now I\u2019m living a life where I accept that God and I both know I will screw up and he loves me anyway. I grew up being shown that I would be shown love if I behaved in a certain manner and love would be withheld if my parents disliked my behavior. I made the mistake of thinking God\u2019s love was conditional (based on my behavior) like man\u2019s love. What helped me was reading the words in the Bible that God love man while we were still sinners. I other words, God loved is at our most F\u2019d up when we weren\u2019t even thinking about serving him. He sent his son to die for him while we were F\u2019d up. That means there is never a point or behavior I can do that will stop God from loving me, full stop.  I also found it helpful to read in the Bible ( I like the amplified b/c it\u2019s easier to understand but there is a version for everyone) about people who screwed up and God still blessed and was proud of them. God called David his friend and said David was a man after his own heart. David was a murderer. Jesus still came through David\u2019s lineage. People make a relationship with Jesus more complicated than it is. You can talk to Jesus plainly. Let Jesus know that you want to know him better and you want him to show you have to behave in a way that is pleasing to him. Something will show up to help you do this. I like Joyce Meyer\u2019s podcast; but it\u2019s not about finding the right minister or church. Just ask Jesus to direct you, and the guidance will just happen. God has given me guidance through secular movies, books and songs. Just be on the lookout for God\u2019s guidance anywhere and you will find it. Good luck. I hope this helps!",

You are more self aware than the vast majority of Evangelicals. Personally I do not think God cares if you smoke weed. He even told us explicitly that he gave us all the seed bearing plants. That is what it says. Now could it get out of hand - of course it *could* . But as long as your aren't starving your children in order to afford your cannabis or you are not spending an inordinate sum that could be used to buy a hungry person food I think it's ok to spend a little on that. It's not *just* about getting high. Paul told Timothy \" no longer drink water exclusively but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments\". Now yes he said wine but think about the sentiment of what it is saying. I don't think it's like \"oh you don't like wine, no relief for you\". I hope this helps.",

Amen.\n\nIt comes from Philippians -\n\nBe anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. - Philippians 4:6-7\n\n(One of my favorite passages of all time!)",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have been working as a machine learning engineer for some 8 years now after getting a Master's degree in computer science. Have worked on a lot of different projects, ranging from OLS to neural networks.\n\nFor now having a broad idea of how these mathematical models / methods worked was enough but I would like to develop a more rigorous understanding. So I bought the PRML book from Bishop. Well, here my basic understanding of mathematics immediately became apparent. I have had basic calculus (derivations, integration, Taylor expansions) and Linear Algebra (systems of linear equations, determinants etc) in college but I'm just lacking the maturity to really understand what is happening in a graduate level machine learning book.\n\nSo, I put the PRML book back in the bookcase and started thinking about how I could improve my mathematical maturity / reasoning skills. I am sure I want to do some courses, since simply working through a calculus book won't keep me motivated enough. I have the Stewart calculus book from college but I think it would be unreasonable to work through a 1000 page calculus book.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best way for a college CS math level student be to improve this maturity? I think my options are\n\n1. picking up a pure mathematics course where I learn the foundations(?), example:\n\n[https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/details/m208](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/details/m208)\n\n2.  picking up a applied mathematics / physics course. example: [https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/details/mst210](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/details/mst210)\n\nI read that some people tend to learn better having concrete examples, so I'm inclined going for the second approach.\n\n\n\nTLDR; CS person with basic math understanding. Trying to choose between pure mathematics and applied mathematics to improve his mathematical maturity / understanding.\n\n",

My husband and I have a short list of baby girl names and I have (had?) one front runner, but when I excitedly told my husband he made a joke about a politician that isn\u2019t well liked and now I\u2019m afraid other people will make that association. The short list is:\n\nSophie, Margot, Marjorie, With the last name being my favorite with her middle name being Marie, would be a slight nod to my given name after my grandmother. Can you guys tell me if I\u2019m thinking too hard about her being made fun of for being named Marjorie and people thinking of Marjorie Taylor Green? Nicknames for Marjorie including Marge, Margie, Peg, Peggy which I all love. ",

        "selftext": " [https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/march-26-2024](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/march-26-2024)\n\nAt about 1:30 this morning, local time, the *Dali*, a 985-foot (300 m) container ship operating under a Singapore flag, struck the steel Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, that spans the lower Patapsco River and outer Baltimore Harbor. The bridge immediately collapsed.\u00a0\n\nEight maintenance workers were on the bridge repairing potholes when the ship hit. Two were rescued from the water, but the other six remain missing. Search and rescue operations were complicated by twisted metal and debris from the collapsed bridge. This evening, the Coast Guard called off its search. Tomorrow morning, divers will begin recovery efforts.\n\nIt is possible there were motorists on the bridge, too, but fewer than there might otherwise have been. Crew members issued a \u201cMayday\u201d call\u2014an internationally recognized word meaning distress\u2014that Maryland police heard. At 1:27, police radio recorded an officer saying a ship had lost control of its steering as it approached the bridge, and to stop traffic and evacuate the area. There were cars submerged in the water, but they may have belonged to the construction workers.\n\nThe loss of the bridge will tangle traffic and disrupt supply chains. Named for the Maryland lawyer who in 1814 wrote the poem that became the national anthem, the Francis Scott Key bridge carries I-695, the Baltimore Beltway, and is used by about 30,000 people a day.\u00a0\n\nThe Port of Baltimore is one of the nation\u2019s largest shipping hubs, especially for both imports and exports of cars and light trucks. About 850,000 vehicles go through that port every year. So does more than 20% of the nation\u2019s coal exports. In 2023 the port moved a record-breaking $80 billion worth of foreign cargo. Now the shipping lane is closed and must be cleared of debris.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is no question this will be a major and protracted impact on supply chains,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said from Baltimore today.\n\nPerhaps learning from the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment, when the government response was fast but quiet and thus opened a window for right-wing complaints they weren\u2019t doing enough, the administration was out front today. Buttigieg rushed to the scene from a trip out West, and Maryland governor Wes Moore told reporters Buttigieg had called him at 3:30 am, just two hours after the crash.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBy around 6:00 am, the National Transportation Safety Board already had a team of 24 people on the scene to launch an investigation into the cause of the collision.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking today, President Joe Biden said: \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as\u2026humanly possible. And we\u2019re going to work hand in hand\u2026to support Maryland, whatever they ask for. And we\u2019re going to work with our partners in Congress to make sure the state gets the support it needs. It\u2019s my intention that federal government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing that bridge, and I expect\u2026the Congress to support my effort.\u201d\n\nFormer member of President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign Jason Karsh noted Biden\u2019s speech and said on social media: \u201c\\[B\\]ecause Biden got infrastructure spending done for the first time in over a generation, and because \\[Pennsylvania\\] was able to rebuild that bridge that collapsed in record time, Dem\\[ocrat\\]s have the credibility to say things like this. Competence in government matters.\u201d\n\nIt remains far too soon for any solid understanding of what caused the deadly crash.\n\nDespite the impossibility of solid information in the hours immediately after the collision\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014verified accounts on X (formerly Twitter) began spreading conspiracy theories. They posted that the accident was linked to terrorism, Jewish people, or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. \u201cDid anti-white business practices cause this disaster?\u201d one posted. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones wrote that the collision was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and that \u201cWW3 has already started.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTechnology reporter Taylor Lorenz, who studies social media patterns, explained in the *Washington Post* that many of these accounts are \u201cengagement farming.\u201d This is the practice of posting extremist comments to generate attention, which can then be monetized by, for example, getting a cut of advertising that appears near those comments. Comments with heavy engagement can receive thousands of dollars.\u00a0\n\nFor a long time now, America\u2019s political right has riled people up with wild political rhetoric to get them to buy stuff. Just today, Trump began to hawk Bibles for $59.99, plus shipping and handling, with a video message saying \u201cReligion and Christianity are the biggest things missing from this country, and I truly believe we need to bring them back\u2026. That\u2019s why our country\u2019s going haywire\u2014we\u2019ve lost religion in our country.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThat system appeared to be in play as Trump supporters apparently flocked to today\u2019s public offering of the Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the Truth Social app, sending the stock upward 16%. That surge would value the company at more than $7 billion, although in the first nine months of last year it had only about $3 million in sales and lost nearly $50 million. Julian Klymochko, founder and CEO of Accelerate Financial Technologies, told NPR\u2019s Rafael Nam that the $7 billion valuation \u201cis completely detached from any sort of fundamentals.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBuying stock in the company is \u201cmore of a political movement or just a speculative meme stock \\[a stock driven by social media\\] that\u2019s completely detached or unrelated to the underlying business fundamentals of Truth Social,\u201d Klymochko said.\n\nAs well as convincing supporters to buy products, extremist rhetoric can push them toward violence. Yesterday, John Keller, the head of a Department of Justice task force set up to protect election workers, told reporters Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen has put the U.S. in a \u201cnew era\u201d in which election workers are \u201cscapegoated, targeted, and attacked.\u201d\u00a0\n\nToday, on his social media network, Trump attacked individuals related to his upcoming election interference case. He lashed out at one of the prosecutors on Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s staff who previously worked for the Justice Department; Judge Juan Merchan, the judge in his upcoming criminal case for election interference; and the judge\u2019s daughter. Of the judge and his daughter, Trump told his angry followers: \u201cThese COUNTRY DESTROYING SCOUNDRELS & THUGS HAVE NO CASE AGAINST ME. WITCH HUNT!\u201d\u00a0\n\nLegal analyst Joyce White Vance of *Civil Discourse* called out Trump\u2019s \u201crank effort at intimidating the judge by threatening his family,\u201d which she said \u201cmerits a gag order but also serious pushback from \\[Republican\\] leadership\u2014which we know won't come.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRepublican leadership indeed stayed quiet, but the judge noted Trump\u2019s pattern of using\u00a0 \u201cthreatening, inflammatory, \\[and\\] denigrating\u201d statements against individuals in his legal cases and placed a gag order on him. Merchan noted that in the past, Trump\u2019s statements had intimidated the individual targeted and required them to hire protection.\u00a0\n\nTrump can still talk about Merchan or Bragg, but he cannot comment on any attorney, court staff member, or family member of prosecutors or lawyers. He can\u2019t make statements about any potential or actual juror.\u00a0\n\nOther news today suggests that Americans outside the MAGA bubble are turning against the poisonous politics that appeals to fear and hatred so its perpetrators can gain money or power.\n\nThe outrage over NBC\u2019s hiring of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel was so strong that today the chair of NBC News, Cesar Conde, emailed staff to tell them he had \u201cdecided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d McDaniel had trafficked in lies to support Trump and had worked with him to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine* today, observers thought the justices seemed inclined to back away from the decision of extremist antiabortion judge Matthew Kacsmaryk taking the abortion drug mifepristone off the market. Antiabortion activists have long sought to ban abortion nationwide, but a strong majority of Americans support reproductive rights and have made their wishes known at the ballot box.\u00a0\n\nVoters\u2019 frustration with the extremists who have captured the Republican Party appeared to be behind the results in today\u2019s special election for a seat in the Alabama legislature. There, voters in a swing district elected a Democrat, who ran on protecting abortion access, to replace a Republican. In 2022 that Democrat, Marilyn Lands, won about 45% of the vote. Today she won almost 65% of it.\n\n\u2014\n\nNotes:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/26/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/26/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/26/victims-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/26/victims-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse/)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-what-we-know/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-what-we-know/index.html)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/26/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-maryland/#link-RHQ7HYBG55GEDA7VZ6QFNESUHQ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/26/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-maryland/#link-RHQ7HYBG55GEDA7VZ6QFNESUHQ)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/trump-selling-60-god-bless-the-usa-bibles-with-lee-greenwood.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/trump-selling-60-god-bless-the-usa-bibles-with-lee-greenwood.html)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240890579/truth-social-trump-media-and-technology-group-trump-net-worth](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240890579/truth-social-trump-media-and-technology-group-trump-net-worth)\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/25/us-election-officials-threats-taskforce-trump-warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/25/us-election-officials-threats-taskforce-trump-warning)\n\n[https://www.axios.com/2024/03/26/doj-threats-election-workers-harassment](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/26/doj-threats-election-workers-harassment)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/politics/trump-hush-money-trial-gag-order/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/politics/trump-hush-money-trial-gag-order/index.html)\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-collapse-of-the-francis-scott-key-bridge/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-collapse-of-the-francis-scott-key-bridge/)\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/ntsb-gives-timeline-of-baltimore-bridge-collapse-response-207716421926](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/ntsb-gives-timeline-of-baltimore-bridge-collapse-response-207716421926)\n\n[https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/26/4-big-unknowns-after-the-baltimore-bridge-collapse-00149126](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/26/4-big-unknowns-after-the-baltimore-bridge-collapse-00149126)\n\n[https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/26/24112540/supreme-court-mifepristone-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine-abortion-pills](https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/26/24112540/supreme-court-mifepristone-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine-abortion-pills)\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/justice-briefs-election-threats](https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/justice-briefs-election-threats)\n\n[https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/26/abortion-winning-strategy-alabama-democrat-00149205](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/26/abortion-winning-strategy-alabama-democrat-00149205)\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/ntsb-gives-timeline-of-baltimore-bridge-collapse-response-207716421926](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/ntsb-gives-timeline-of-baltimore-bridge-collapse-response-207716421926)\n\nTwitter (X):\n\n[sarafischer/status/1772747005615566932](https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1772747005615566932)\n\n[JoyceWhiteVance/status/1772650642240057616](https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1772650642240057616)\n\n[jkarsh/status/1772670818884977120](https://twitter.com/jkarsh/status/1772670818884977120)",

I have immense gratitude for all those who have given up their time to do this study, thank you all so much! Please see below for all the information.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm a trainee clinical psychologist conducting a research project for my doctorate thesis at Lancaster University. The study is investigating the relationship between childhood trauma and self-concept clarity (that is, having a clear sense of who you are as a person). I'm also looking to see how self-defining memories play a role in this relationship.\n\nThe study is entirely online and takes about 10 mins to complete. Participants must be UK residents, at least 21 years old, and identify as having experienced at least one traumatic event before 18 years of age.\n\n**Click the link** [**here**](https://bit.ly/48eE9vJ) **to be taken to the study** and receive more information. Please fully read the information and instructions before taking part. (Note for during the study: if you are able to do so, please type a description of your memory into the text box).\n\nPlease share on any social media, forums or groups you're involved in that you think is appropriate, or with anyone you think may be interested in taking part.\n\nThe study has been given ethical approval by Lancaster University FHM Research Ethics Committee.\n\nI'm really hoping to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal, and that this research can help improve our understanding of the psychological impact of experiencing childhood trauma, and how this may increase likelihood of experiencing mental health difficulties in later life.\n\nThe study closes in April 2024. Once the study is complete I will share a summary of the findings on this thread, and on my research instagram and X pages u/Melanie_ClinPsy.\n\nMassive thank you to anyone who has supported this study. I'm very grateful to you all.\n\nMelanie Taylor",

I can take or leave gore and/or romance subplots.\n\nHere are a list of books I've read and loved/hated and why:\n\nThe Others by Anne Bishop -A whole world of shifters? I reread this series every few years.\n\nFrostbite/Overwinter - David Wellington -A bleak isolation horror that stayed with me, but probably won't read again.\n\nSuch Sharp Teeth - Rachel Harrison -Didn't really stay with me, which is a shame because I love her other works.\n\nMongrels - Stephen Graham Jones -An incredibly compelling slice-of-life horror take. Love his writing.\n\nMercy Thompson/Alpha & Omega by Patricia Briggs -Absolutely the type of pack dynamics I LOVE to read about!\n\nOtherworld by Kelley Armstrong -Urban fantasy with Were side characters that are incredibly important to the story. Fun for what it is.\n\nWho's Afraid - Maria Lewis -This Australian author takes us all over the world in this UF series.\n\nWolfsong - TJ Klune -A spectacular gay romance UF series. Heart-melting and I only want to feel like this sometimes!\n\nGil's All Fright Diner - A Lee Martinez -An apocalyptic horror-comedy that I frequently revisit.\n\nBride - Ali Hazelwood - An alternate-history romance that was...fun in its way. Loved the pack in it.\n\nThe Pack - Jason Starr -The most boring werewolf book I've ever finished.\n\nThe Wolves are Watching - Natalie Lund -A YA novel about wolf women who live in the woods and want to grow their numbers... delicious.\n\nEmpire of Wild - Cherie Dimaline -A literary horror using religion and lots of Wolf in Sheep's Clothing references. Intriguing tale.\n\nBooks I own/know of that I plan to read:\n\nCycle of the Werewolf - Stephen King\nThe Bite - ZW Taylor\nOrgan Meats - K-Ming Chang\n\nI would love some fierce recommendations. \ud83d\ude09",

I'm reposting to let you know the study will be closing end of the day on Monday 1st April, so if you want to have your experience captured in the findings, please take part while you still have time.\n\nWe have reached the minimum number of participants needed for data analysis, which is incredible! I am so grateful to all those who have given up their time to complete this study! The more datasets we have, the more reliable the findings will be, the more representative the data will be of the UK wide population, and the more confident we can be in the conclusions drawn. Please see all the information below. Huge thank you to all of you!  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nHi everyone,\n\n  \nMy name is Melanie Taylor and I'm a trainee clinical psychologist at Lancaster University in the UK.  \nI'm doing a research project for my doctorate thesis investigating the relationship between childhood trauma and self-concept clarity (that is, having a clear sense of who you are as a person). I'm also looking to see how self-defining memories play a role.\n\n  \n**Who can take part?**\n\nParticipants must be:\n\n* UK residents\n* Fluent in English\n* At least 21 years old  \n\n\nAND identify as having experienced at least one traumatic event before 18 years of age.  \nAn event which is traumatic includes any experience which you found very stressful, frightening or distressing.  \nThis may have involved:\n\n* Experiencing or witnessing aggression, violence, emotional or sexual abuse\n* Experiencing or witnessing accident or injury\n* Experiencing illness or someone close to you experiencing illness\n* Loss or bereavement\n* Parental separation\n* Experiencing bullying\n* Natural disaster\n* Living through and/or escaping conflict\n\nThis list is not full - you may have experienced something else which you found traumatic.  \n\n\n**What does the study involve?**  \nThe study is entirely online and takes about 10-15 mins to complete. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to type out a childhood memory in a paragraph, and complete three questionnaires. Please type the memory out in the text box if you are able to.  \nYou are free to withdraw at any time without penalty or having to give a reason.\n\n# [Click here to go to the study.](https://bit.ly/48eE9vJ)\n\n  \nPlease make sure you read all the information and instructions fully and carefully before taking part.  \nI will end recruitment in April 2024. Once it is ready, I will share a summary of the findings on this post, and also on my X and instagram research pages u/Melanie_ClinPsy.\n\n  \nI'm also hoping to publish the findings in an academic peer reviewed journal, and that it will help influence further research into understanding the psychological impact of experiencing childhood trauma.\n\n  \nThank you so much to everyone for your support, I'm incredibly grateful for your time!\n\n  \nIf you have any questions or queries, please email me at [M.Taylor14@lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:M.Taylor14@lancaster.ac.uk)\n\n  \nThis study has been given ethical approval by Lancaster University FHM Research Ethics Committee.",

        "selftext": "The film follows a pair of two teenagers Amanda (Olivia Cooke) and Lily (Anya Taylor Joy) who used to be friends when they were younger but have since become estranged. Amanda is an emotionless sociopath while Lily is overly intelligent, they cross each other\u2019s lives again when Lily is paid to tutor Amanda but soon develop a plot to murder Lily\u2019s emotionally abusive Stepdad. \n\nAn amazingly written sharp black comedy that also manages to be extremely thought provoking  with standout performances from both Cooke and Taylor-Joy before they were as well known. It\u2019s a fantastic watch and truly so underrated.",

I can take or leave gore and/or romance subplots.\n\nHere are a list of books I've read and loved/hated and why:\n\nThe Others by Anne Bishop -A whole world of shifters? I reread this series every few years.\n\nFrostbite/Overwinter - David Wellington -A bleak isolation horror that stayed with me, but probably won't read again.\n\nSuch Sharp Teeth - Rachel Harrison -Didn't really stay with me, which is a shame because I love her other works.\n\nMongrels - Stephen Graham Jones -An incredibly compelling slice-of-life horror take. Love his writing.\n\nMercy Thompson/Alpha & Omega by Patricia Briggs -Absolutely the type of pack dynamics I LOVE to read about!\n\nOtherworld by Kelley Armstrong -Urban fantasy with Were side characters that are incredibly important to the story. Fun for what it is.\n\nWho's Afraid - Maria Lewis -This Australian author takes us all over the world in this UF series.\n\nWolfsong - TJ Klune -A spectacular gay romance UF series. Heart-melting and I only want to feel like this sometimes!\n\nGil's All Fright Diner - A Lee Martinez -An apocalyptic horror-comedy that I frequently revisit.\n\nBride - Ali Hazelwood - An alternate-history romance that was...fun in its way. Loved the pack in it.\n\nThe Pack - Jason Starr -The most boring werewolf book I've ever finished.\n\nThe Wolves are Watching - Natalie Lund -A YA novel about wolf women who live in the woods and want to grow their numbers... delicious.\n\nEmpire of Wild - Cherie Dimaline -A literary horror using religion and lots of Wolf in Sheep's Clothing references. Intriguing tale.\n\nBooks I own/know of that I plan to read:\n\nCycle of the Werewolf - Stephen King\nThe Bite - ZW Taylor\nOrgan Meats - K-Ming Chang\n\nI would love some fierce recommendations. \ud83d\ude09",

        "selftext": "Just had my appointment with Dr Heer and wanted to report back for anyone who is curious. First off, he\u2019s great. Very nice and really cares about figuring out this bacteria, though he admits it\u2019s unfortunately very under-studied. But he seems to be doing his research. His 90 minute consultation is fabulous because he asks you EVERYTHING and really listens.\n\n I didn\u2019t expect him to come up with a full game plan for me, but he did. This makes me partly nervous because I had planned to basically request clarith and he\u2019d go \u201cok\u201d, but that was not what happened. But it also makes me feel good that he is trying to taylor a plan to me personally. He listened to allllll my symptoms, journey, full health history and devised a plan. He also wants me to do a full blood panel and another test I can\u2019t remember the name of to hopefully get a picture of how my body heals and deals with things like infection. I like this approach so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\nTHE GAME PLAN:\n- He told me to stay on Doxy for now, but he thinks it needs some help and biofilm disruption.\n- He is going to put me on methylene blue twice a day for 4 weeks, to start. (It\u2019s expensive without insurance! Eeek.)\n- He also wants me to start Kirkman\u2019s biofilm disrupter.\n\nHe implied this was a pretty hardcore regime, so we\u2019ll see.\nI\u2019m nervous about this and know nothing about methylene blue (he said some recent studies in Asia look very positive on it) but he said the goal of the plan is to \u201crelease and kill, release and kill\u201d - and that sounds good to me! We follow up in 2 weeks. \n\nWould love thoughts or input from anyone on this plan if you have any knowledge on it, but in general I wanted to give people an idea of what Heer is like for anyone interested in him.\n\nSend me all the good vibes. I\u2019m happy to have something new to try but mentally I\u2019m not feeling super optimistic right now. I\u2019m scared. \nHope everyone is hanging in there. ",

He has found a couple genetic mutations in me that he has found in other patients as well, so he is trying to connect the dots and see if they can be correlated. \n\nHe probably wants you to stay on the doxy for now to see if it works with the biofilm disruptors. However, if it any point your symptoms get unbearable and you feel like the doxy isn\u2019t working, feel free to message him and ask to switch to Clarith. He is generally very willing to try new medicines. \n\nMethylene blue is a really good option and I have used it myself. Beware at first it might irritate your bladder more but your body will adjust to it. Also beware it will stain your underwear so you might want to grab a pack of cheap all black ones lol.",

If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**\n\n- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.\n\n- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.\n\n- Since this is a paid request (you've set the \"paid\" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.\n\n- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to \"Solved\" by commenting \"SOLVED\" and thank those who helped you.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And the uncomfortable question she must ask herself now is how much longer will the transcendent ecstasy of doomed romance continue to be her flagship muse? At what point will the bittersweet thrill of youthful dalliance run its course? What happens when Taylor, heaven forbid, awakens from her \u201cLavender Haze\u201d and finds her happily ever after \u2014 the \u201cEndgame\u201d she has so desperately craved from her Reputation days? What does the Taylor who settles down, has children look like? How will the happily married Matron Taylor reconcile with the vaingloriously unmoored Young Adult Novel Taylor? How will this affect her art, her brand, her image? Will her fans, her cult, continue to swear fealty? How will Taylor navigate her \u201cEndgame\u201d dilemma? In capitulating to true love, must she sacrifice her \u2018promethean fire\u2019 \u2014 the muse that\u2019s brought her so much success? Does she wither away into obscurity like so many of her popstar forebears? Or will she defy the odds and find new ways to resonate with age? \"*",

I\u2019ve listened to all of her albums, and so that I don\u2019t get banned from here, I\u2019ll keep my speculations to myself, but some of the deep cuts on *folklore*, *evermore*, and *Midnights* (specifically the 3 am tracks) suggest that she has experienced trials and hardships but isn\u2019t willing to explicitly talk about them yet. Again, I have my suspicions, but I don\u2019t want to get banned. But I will say that \u201cthis is me trying\u201d from *folklore* is one of my fav songs by her and reveals quite a lot about her. \n\nTo be more objective, nobody can last forever. I wasn\u2019t alive in the 80s, but I\u2019m sure that Madonna had endless speculation about when she would eventually fail. Yet, she sustained her career for quite some time, and she faltered only sometime in the 2010s due to a multitude of factors. \n\nNobody knows when one will naturally start to lose that energy or spark.

For various reasons I was sorta stuck in bed and bored outta my mind and found [this 2019 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/cqcntu/a_breakdown_of_taylor_swifts_genre_of_music/) on r/TaylorSwift basically categorizing all her songs into different genres/subgenres. I wanted to make an updated version of it but since TTPD is only a month a way I decided to wait until it gets released and wanted to make post like it for other artists I like,such as Carly Rae Jepsen! Most of her songs are obviously pure pop, but pop has a lot of subgenres, so I thought it would be fun to categorize it. I\u2019ll be listening songs from all of her albums, as well as the Curiosity and Emotion Side B EP as well as some stand alone singles and features. \n\nDisclaimer: A lot of Carly\u2019s songs fall under several subgenres so to not make this list long I just categorize each song into whatever genre I feel like it belongs to the best.

        "selftext": "So we know how the lover house burns down and how TTPD(The Tortured Poets Department:Out April 19) is most likely a break album about Joe Alwyn and that she is gonna 'move' in somewhere new with the new era. She probobly burned down the lover house since it has so many memories and it was the Midnight's era who burnt it down since in the cover taylor has a lighter. Taylor Swift first moves in the Lover House with Joe Alwyn and when folklore came in everything was going fine but on Evermore, things start to slowly break and Midnight's album Taylor was drunk and mad (joking lmao) and the song \"You're losing me.\" was like a sign that Joe Alwyn is losing Taylor since she realized he is Joe Alwyn but he failed to realize she is THE Taylor Swift. So on some time of the start of the Eras Tour Taylor and Joe broke up but she started to write TTPD in 2022 probobly so it has been a long time coming... (btw she is on a hangover currently as TTPD cover shows.)\n\nShe is a Mastemind.\n\n\\*This means no hate to her since im a swiftie and this is that a theory and give credits if you will use it\\*",

        "selftext": "Everyone says that the first Pokemon movie titled, \"Mewtwo Strikes Back\" is better in Japanese because it was Shudo's true intentions for the series and that the dub completely changed the whole idea for the franchise has a whole. But however, I think the movie is beat scene in English dubbed than in the Japanese version and I am going to give the reason why now.\n\nThe first reason has the be the voice acting for the dub. the dub voice actors in this movie give it their all when they were saying their lines whether it is Veronica Taylor bringing Ash's determination and willpower when he was confronting Mewtwo or Jay Goade's whole perforce in this dub with his unique and deep booming voice for the character.  \n\nThe second reason why I prefer the dub of this movie is due to the [soundtrack](https://youtu.be/Qrk1H9j9r0Y?si=lVVL0ZEbGBqVD8HQ) that was made for the dub. the soundtrack enlists of late 90s to early 2000s pop songs that are sung by A to B-list artists that fit the era of the movie well in my opinion.  One of the songs that made a scene iconic was the Brother my Brother song that was played during the fight scene with the original pokemon vs the clones. The song really captured the emotions and tensity of the battle that it telling that the clones and originals should not be fighting to the death and all of them are both living beings that had life. \n\nTo summarize, the dub of Mewtwo Strikes Back was way better than people had made it out to be. I can actually admit that the sub may have a better vision of what Shudo envisioned for the franchise, but the dub made it better to the voice acting and music that made the dub entertaing to watch.

        "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a post discussing my least favorite Dhar Mann actors. Now time to discuss my favorites. Even though my thoughts on Dhar Mann's channel as a whole is negative, I do like more actors than I dislike. But unfortunately, not even the best acting can save a lot of Dhar's scripts. These are the actors who I genuinely enjoy seeing on screen because they're either great actors, great people, or both. Many of these actors are no longer with Dhar Mann as they quit last year after the protests. Here is my list\n\n10. **Ayana Taylor**:  Even though she stayed after the protests, I still think of her as one of the OG actors(probably because she hasn\u2019t been in many recent videos). She had great chemistry with many of the older actors like Chas, Carlos, and Mair. Even on her own, she's pretty good and I can't think of any character from her I actively disliked.\n\n9. **Michael Vaccaro**: Even though he always plays a rich snobby asshole, he does a damn good job at it. Not to mention I remember him in particular roasting the shit out of Dhar after the protests.\n\n8. **Carlos Chavez**: Chas and Carlos are definitely the best duo on Dhar Mann, they can(sometimes) make even the dumbest scripts enjoyable to watch. Carlos is my favorite goody two-shoes Dhar Mann actor. I know this is Dhar's fault really, but the reason he's not higher is because he only ever played the good guy. I wish they had him play a villain at least once. I also loved how he reacted to one of AugustTheDuck's commentaries agreeing with the criticisms.\n\n7. **Rachel Christianson**: The best mom actor on Dhar Mann without a doubt. She's played some bad moms, but most of her mom characters are actually pretty good, especially considering how awful parenting is in Dhar Mann Land. Even her more Karen-esque characters aren't nearly as unlikeable as Katherine's or Rebecca's. She also seems really cool irl.\n\n6. **Chris Ready**: Whether he's playing a nice character or a villain, he just nails all his roles. He is objectively one of the best actors Dhar Mann has had, and even the bad videos he's in, his acting is still great. I especially like when he scarily confronts other characters.\n\n5. **Colin Borden**: He basically led the effort to protest Dhar Mann. Aside from that, most of his characters are really nice, and he just seems like a really chill and cool guy irl. He's had some bad characters(like Ruby's dad and Mr. Wilson in a couple vids), but far more good I think.\n\n4. **Mair Mulroney**: Another actor Dhar made a mistake underpaying and/or firing. She really started attacking him after the protests and I loved it. Even though she usually played a villain in his videos, she always had a likeable charm to her and had great chemistry with the other actors.\n\n3. **Eliot**: Yes, that's his full legal name. Like Chris, he is also objectively a great actor. He does a good job when he plays a mean authority figure(principal, cop, boss, judge, etc.) because he's not super scary(like the actor for Mikey's dad), but just scary enough. He's made some otherwise bad videos semi-enjoyable to watch.\n\n2. **Azeem Vecchio**: Obvious choice, there's a reason the Antwan series and Christmas family fight videos are some of the only videos people generally like on here. He has some genuine talent, and honestly deserves much better scripts. He nails every role, whether it be dark and serious, or silly.\n\n1. **Chas Laughlin**: It's amazing how someone who almost exclusively plays sloppily written villains has so much likeability. Like I said before, I especially enjoy when he acts aside Carlos, and he has the power to make badly written scripts enjoyable(albeit ironically sometimes). He's a likeable guy irl, which I think contributes to why I like his characters so much. Tate tries to fill the void he left in more recent videos, but doesn\u2019t come close to having the same charm.\n\nWho are your favorite actors? Leave your thoughts in the comments.",

He also made like a 5 part TikTok explaining Dhar's working conditions. Jackie Tran has largely replaced his roles since the protests, he's not bad, but doesn't fill the void Nathan left.\n\n\\- **Carl Judie**: He was a likeable actor and guy, sad that he passed. RIP\n\n\\- **Ayden Mekus & Devon Weetly**: They're my second favorite duo next to Chas & Carlos. I especially like when they play a bully/nerd duo. Each actor is also talented on their own.\n\n\\- **Vinn Sander**: Another OG. Whether he's playing a good guy or a scammer, I enjoy seeing him on screen.",

And as a whole, Republicans tend to vote *against* those exact same things they claim we should be spending the $60b sent to Ukraine on. For example, while the bipartisan infrastructure package passed, it did so with just a handful of Republican votes in the House and Senate. Far less than half the Republicans in each chamber supported the legislation. \n\n>You can disagree and think it is still worth sending (I do) but it is coherent.\n\nYou're right, it is coherent. Republicans want to block aid to Ukraine, so they make up bs excuses for why it shouldn't be passed despite those same politicians not wanting to spend the money on those things either. It's coherent, its just cynical, nefarious, and immoral too.",

In fact some of the parents did get a surprising amount of story development, considering it\u2019s a show about teens/young adults.\n\nHere are the missed opportunities for me:\n\nD\u2019Shawn - The biggest missed opportunity of the entire series. He had great chemistry with the cast, especially Donna. This is really where 90210 is a sad product of more overtly racist times. There\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t be series regular on a version of the show made today.\n\nSherice - She was easily one of the best guest stars of the week from the HS years. The writers missed a huge opportunity to integrate a Black family into the show. I think the entire Ashe family should\u2019ve been featured. \n\nMariah - Amazing chemistry with Brandon. Thwarted for the same reasons the two previous characters were.\n\nDan - I think he would\u2019ve potentially been a better fit with the gang and been overall more interesting for Andrea than Jesse.\n\nEmily - The college years version of her should\u2019ve been brought on as a regular. To me Brandon\u2019s romantic peak came and went with his time in San Francisco with Emily Valentine. I loved that version of the character and them as a couple.\n\nCeleste - While I appreciate them bringing her back and expanding the role, I can\u2019t fathom why they made Clare a series regular over her. I think she would\u2019ve fit in great with the group and I could see her meshing well with all the girls and most of the guys.",

Its not easy to trust or love again when you've been cheated on or used by someone, but she is able to do it somehow. \n\nShe doesn't NEED a guy in her life, but she wants one, she loves love and is willing and able to stand up to the risk of heartbreak and sadness that comes with that.",

        "selftext": " In this article, you will learn the factors that affect the value your business and will help you get your business into the best possible health.\n\n \n\nThinking of selling? Or just curious to know the [value of your business](https://msitaylor.com.au/) in case you do decide to put it on the market at some point?\n\nMany business owners are well-wide of the mark when placing a value on their prized asset. They overvalue it and under-prepare for their exit, believing in a huge potential for their business that buyers unfortunately don\u2019t see.\n\n*Your business is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it!*\n\nHaving an inflated price fixed in your head can seriously hold up your exit strategy. Awareness of the factors considered in determining business value will help you avoid nasty surprises when you do take the plunge.\n\nSome factors are obvious; others not so. Some you have control over; and others you don\u2019t.\n\nUnderstanding what influences business value enables you to take informed actions to increase it in the coming months or years.\n\nBelow is a boiled-down guide to ten of the most important considerations\u2026\n\n##### 1. Reasons for selling\n\nWhy are you selling the business? If you\u2019re forced to sell (and this is known by the buyer), the value of the business naturally falls.\n\nSelling due to owner illness is a good example where you are in a poor bargaining position when it comes to selling.\n\nTry to give yourself as long as possible to negotiate before you sell; rapid, forced sales will ultimately be detrimental.\n\n##### 2. Size of business\n\nWith all other things being equal, smaller businesses are often viewed as higher risk than larger, more established companies.\n\nThe very fact that the business has more employees and generates higher revenues may be seen as a sign that it is strong. After all, it must have survived difficulties in the market in the past and possesses the people and processes that have created an environment for growth.\n\nA larger business tends to indicate stability \u2014 and prospective buyers like to see this.\n\n##### 3. Longevity of the business\n\nHow many years has your business been operating?\n\nWhile potential is a very important factor in determining value, so is a strong track record over many years.\n\nIf you can demonstrate years of strong performance, steady cash flow, and an established loyal customer base generating stable recurring revenues, you are ticking many potential buyer boxes.\n\nBusinesses that have been trading for a year or two are far higher risk, even if they are performing well. They may be simply riding the market or a particular trend.\n\n##### 4. The nature of your business\u2019s assets\n\nIf you run a manufacturing business, your tangible assets are much greater than most office-based businesses and this is a factor in its value.\n\nIf everything else is equal, building ownership, hardware, machinery, and stock make a business much easier to value than one where intellectual property is the main asset.\n\nIn reality, the value of a business depends upon many other factors that office-based businesses may score well with (such as customer loyalty, IP, brand strength, etc.)\u2026 so this factor needs to be balanced against the others mentioned here.\n\nFor a simple \u2018asset valuation\u2019 of your business, add up the tangible assets, subtract the liabilities, and that\u2019s it!\n\n##### 5. The key financials: EBIT\n\nWhat are your business\u2019s\u00a0***earnings before interest and tax***\u00a0(EBIT)?\n\nAny prospective buyer will want to know this figure as the most common basis for calculating the value of a business.\n\nIt essentially puts a figure on your profit. This includes all the expenses in the business, except interest and income tax expenses.\n\nAnother way to put it is: the difference between operating revenues and operating expenses.\n\nA multiple of EBIT is a common method of valuing a business. For example, a 3 times EBIT multiple for a business with an EBIT of $400,000 gives a $1.2M valuation.\u00a0 Or a 5 times multiple on an EBIT of $500,000 gives a valuation of $2.5M.\n\nWhat is considered a \u2018normal\u2019 EBIT multiple to use for valuation purposes?\n\nThis will vary between industries and is affected not only by the factors listed in this article, but also by market sentiment. For example, in a \u2018bull market\u2019 when there are a lot of buyers, valuations are higher and a business could attract a buyer willing to pay a 10 times EBIT multiple. That same business within a different market environment, with a less bullish sentiment many only attract a 3 times EBIT multiple.\n\nClearly, timing matters.\n\n##### 6. Future performance & projected cash flows\n\nWhile past performance can demonstrate financial stability (very important), it\u2019s future performance potential that will get buyers\u2019 eyes lighting up.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be able to show growth potential. With this in mind, how well does your business attract new customers and boost cash flow?\n\nIs it retaining customers effectively so that cash flow and revenue remain healthy \u2014 or are customers dropping off the back as quickly as new ones are loaded onto the front?\n\n##### 7. Your specific industry sector\n\nYour industry sector is important for two main reasons.\n\nFirstly, selling your business at a boom time for your industry will naturally be beneficial over selling it during a depressed time. If you\u2019re in the mining sector and the industry takes a hit, the business value is likely to decrease. Similarly, a prolonged drought might affect the [value of your business](https://msitaylor.com.au/) if you\u2019re in the agricultural sector.\n\nFor more of an idea on your specific industry, speak with us or a business broker experienced in your industry sector. You will be able to access data about recently-sold businesses to get an idea of valuations in your sector.\n\nSecondly, some industry sectors have industry-wide \u2018rules\u2019 that do not necessarily apply to other sectors. For instance, the number of outlets is usually key for a real estate agency business; and customer numbers are key for a mobile phone company.\n\n##### 8. Structure of the deal\n\nThe way the sale is structured may affect the price you sell for. Flexibility to fit in with the needs of the buyer may help you command a higher overall price.\n\nThere are different ways to structure a deal, affecting the amount of tax payable and the debt service: an \u2018all cash\u2019 sale will usually mean a lower value than seller financing.\n\nHere are some basic guidelines:\n\n* *Seller financing:*\u00a0businesses sold without any seller financing generally sell for 10% to 15% less.\n* *Stock sale/Asset sale:*\u00a0selling stock means a single capital gains tax for you but the buyer may prefer an asset sale to reduce income tax.\n* *Allocation of sales price:*\u00a0consulting expenses are tax-deductible to the buyer so they may value a business more with a high allocation to consulting; you, as the seller, may want to limit the allocation to consulting because you will pay the ordinary income tax rate on it.\n\n##### 9. The cost of access to capital in the market\n\nWhen interest rates are high, investors borrow less. It\u2019s the rule of the market.\n\nThis naturally has an effect on the [value of your business](https://msitaylor.com.au/what-we-do/) as there are fewer potential buyers; and any interested parties may drive a harder bargain than when capital is cheaper and more available, as the perceived risk is higher.\n\n##### 10. Other \u2018intangibles\u2019 in the business\n\nThe value of any business will also depend on other more subjective, intangible factors. These may change with the perceptions of different buyers and may be harder to quantify:\n\n* How crucial is the owner to the success of the business?\n* Is it located favourably?\n* Is the business highly dependent on a few customers?\n* Are customer and supplier relationships strong and likely to last?\n* Is the management team and staff strong \u2014 and likely to stay if the business is sold?\n* Does the business have intellectual property of great value (trademarks etc.)?\n* Are systems, processes, and procedures clearly defined and documented?\n* What is the business reputation in the market?\n* Is it favourably placed against competitors?\n* How marketable is the business?\n\n#### Focus on what you can control!\n\nNow you have an idea of the main factors involved in valuing your business, what are the next steps?\n\nBeyond being prepared and making sure that all your paperwork is in order (including cash flow statements, historical and projected profit and loss statements etc.) make sure you have an exit strategy planned.\n\nThis should be flexible enough that you are not in the position of HAVING to sell for less than you would like.\n\nFocus on the factors that you can control rather than those you\u00a0*cannot*. This will help you get your business into the best possible health for when the right opportunity comes along.\n\n[View Source Link:](https://msitaylor.com.au/10-factors-that-affect-the-value-of-your-business/)",

        "selftext": "After watching the discourse on a post about Biden being considered a cop I'm extremely disappointed by the amount of people who are still disillusioned with the idea that Democrats give a fuck about police reform or accountability. \n\nNo one, absolutely no one with even half a brain thinks Trump is better for the country. That doesn't mean we should tolerate Biden as an acceptable alternative. What else has to happen to open your eyes, are your tax dollars being funneled to a fascist government committing genocide because of Biden not a red line for y'all? \n\n\nWe actively make fun of conservatives who have blue line flags and don't tread on me flags but ultimately half the people in here do the same fucking thing. I thought this sub would understand that we cannot trust politicians to deliver a progressive country that doesn't rely on police to keep us from going after the oligarchy. Does anyone think Biden is going to put a stop to cop cities even with a 2nd term? \n\nYou want an actual democracy it's going to have to be by force. Voting will not provide the changes we need fast enough or radically enough. Both parties are aligned, even if one is worse, they will both use the police to keep us all oppressed. ",

        "selftext": "Biden's Reelection Bid Gains Momentum, Yet Polls Against Trump Remain Uncertain. A new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll Tuesday showed hope for Biden as he ticked upward against Trump in six of seven swing states over the last month. Still, there was little to celebrate: He was trailing Trump or statistically tied in all seven states. The poll showed voter perceptions of the economy improving, as did a CNBC national survey finding dead heat. Biden's campaign notes that Democrats have consistently overperformed in the polls since 2022. However, in 2016 and 2020, when Trump was on the ballot, Democrats underperformed in the polls both times. And the Electoral College has built-in advantages for Trump: In 2020, Biden won the popular vote by 7 million and squeaked out an Electoral College win by 45,000 votes in three states. Biden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt declined to comment on the polls but credited him for the improving economy. \"Joe Biden wakes up daily fighting to make life better for the American people,\" she said. \"The President is committed to earning not demanding Americans' votes, unlike Donald Trump who is running a campaign of revenge and retribution for himself and his wealthy friends.\" The Trump campaign said its arguments remain strong. \"Inflation is still wildly out of control, prices of goods are astronomical, the border is an unmitigated disaster with illegals causing bloodbaths in communities across the country, and \\[special counsel Robert\\] Hur called low IQ Crooked Joe an elderly man with a terrible memory unfit actually to stand trial,\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in an email. \"Democrats and the media should stop gaslighting the American people from all the hurt Crooked Joe has caused in just four years.\"' Some of Biden's coalition is still wandering. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he doesn't believe the improving conditions will save Biden because the benefits of lower unemployment and wage growth have been uneven. \"The economy is not uniform,\" he said in an interview. \"In many respects, the elites in our country don't have the same daily experience that many working families do. So I think there's a big disconnect \u2014 some of it is economic, and some is cultural. That's my gut instinct.\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said Biden's struggles are because voters \"are still reeling from the higher prices\" even though inflation is down. He said Biden must speak to ongoing concerns like fentanyl poisoning, mental health, and education. \"The cost of buying a home or renting a home and the cost of pharmaceuticals are high,\" he said, calling for initiatives to \"take on the hedge funds that are buying up the housing market\" and negotiate \"every drug for every American\" to lower medicine costs. \"Team Biden has policies that will improve things in all those areas. And Trump, quite frankly, doesn't,\" he said. \"We've got quite a bit of time before the election for this discussion to take place.\" Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who is bullish on Biden's prospects, said \"large numbers of voters haven't checked in\" and \"some of Biden's coalition is still wandering,\" so surveys show him struggling with young and nonwhite voters. He predicted the polls will improve for Biden by \"late spring,\" around April or May. \"Our view is \u2014 and I share the view of the campaign on this \u2014 that the likely scenario is that a chunk of the coalition will come home in the next few months as it becomes clear that it's Biden-Trump and as the Biden campaign turns on,\" Rosenberg said, \"and then my expectation is we'll be up a few points.\" ",

Although both are often seen as traditionally conservative on this policy, I believe that this aligns with Biden\u2019s base well enough, and independent of saying any beliefs or opinions, it is objectively true that aspects of the same base that supported Biden for his earlier bid, who are now disenfranchised, would see this as a win. Likewise, as an economically focused populist candidate, I can see (and if you look into it, you can see) the less evangelical, more libertarian or capitalistic parts of Trump\u2019s support pushing for legalization, if not for tax purposes alone. \n\nWould like to hear your thoughts!",

        "selftext": " \n\nSo, you\u2019ve reached the milestone of 35. It\u2019s a time when life starts throwing some unexpected curveballs your way. Here are some truths that nobody prepares you for:\n\n1. Losing Your Home Hurts: Imagine being forced to leave the place you poured your heart and soul into. It\u2019s like a stab in the heart, especially after investing your life savings in it. The memories are irreplaceable.\n2. Not All Battles Are Worth Fighting: Sometimes, it\u2019s okay to walk away, even if it feels like giving up. Fighting a losing battle can drain your happiness and energy.\n3. Forgiveness Sets You Free: Holding onto anger only weighs you down. Forgiving those who hurt you, including your parents, can lift a heavy burden off your shoulders.\n4. Beware of Tourists: In life, there are those who are committed to their passions (citizens) and those who jump from one trend to another (tourists). Surround yourself with the former; they\u2019ll inspire and support you.\n5. Take Calculated Risks: Don\u2019t let fear hold you back. Taking calculated risks can lead to growth and fulfillment. Remember, no risks mean no growth.\n6. Invest in Your Health: Neglecting your health now can cost you dearly later. Eat well, exercise, and prioritize self-care to avoid regrets down the road.\n7. Visibility Matters: In a competitive world, being visible is crucial. Don\u2019t hide in the shadows; put yourself out there and seize opportunities.\n8. Embrace Humility: Thinking you know everything can stunt your growth. Stay humble, seek feedback, and constantly strive to improve.\n9. Set High Standards: Don\u2019t settle for mediocrity in any aspect of life. Raise your standards and dare to expect more.\n10. Action Trumps Habit: Waiting for the perfect time to build habits is a trap. Take action now, even when you don\u2019t feel like it, and watch yourself grow.\n11. Embrace Struggle: The best things in life often come after overcoming challenges. Embrace struggle, for it shapes your character and leads to growth.\n12.

        "selftext": "Here are some examples:\n\n\n2020 vs 2008 (two super shift election years where a Democrat won the election. Also both years had an economic catastrophy happen in them)\n\n\n2021 vs 2009 (both very transitional years that saw the inauguration of a new president, buy both cancel each other out, with 2021 being the most changeful year politically but 2009 being the most changeful year culturally. Also, while the aftershock of the recession dominated news headlines in 2009, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to dominate news headlines in 2021)\n\n\n2022 vs 2003 (both political and cultural shift years that saw the beginning of a decade defining war two years after a generation defining historical event, with the Iraq War beginning two years after 9/11 and the Russia-Ukraine War beginning two years after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic)\n\n\n2023 vs 2002 (both political build-up years that were culturally stagnant)\n\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\n\n2001 vs 2020 (both super shift years)\n\n\n2023 vs 2007 (both build-up years)\n\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\n\nShift Battle No. 1 - 2020 vs 2008\n\n\nPolitically - 2020, but there's nothing in it\n\n\nCulturally - 2008\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2008 wins this one. Both years are inseparable politically so it comes down to which year was most changeful culturally, and that was 2008\n\n\nShift Battle No. 2 - 2021 vs 2009\n\n\nPolitically - 2021\n\n\nCulturally - 2009\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2009 wins this one. Although 2021 waw clearly the most changeful year politically, 2009 was just the more well rounded year \n\n\nShift Battle No. 3 - 2022 vs 2003\n\n\nPolitically - 2022, but there's nothing in it\n\n\nCulturally - 2003\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2003 wins this one. Like the 2020 vs 2008 shift battle, both years are inseparable politically, so it comes down to which year was more changeful culturally, so 2003 is the winner\n\n\nShift Battle No. 4 - 2023 vs 2002\n\n\nPolitically - 2023\n\n\nCulturally - 2002 (you'd have to go back to the 1940s or the 1950s to find a year as culturally stagnant as 2023. Although 2002 was stagnant too, it's not in the same league of emptiness as 2023)\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2023 wins this one, as it had major events such as the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, the Trump indictment and the rise of AI. That being said, 2023 would lose in a shift battle against most 2000s years as it was too cultutally stagnant\n\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\n\nShift Battle No. 5 - 2020 vs 2001\n\n\nPolitically - 2020, but there's nothing in it\n\n\nCulturally - 2001\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2001 wins this one. Both years are inseparable politically, but 2001 was definately the most changeful year culturally \n\n\nShift Battle No. 6 - 2023 vs 2007\n\n\nPolitically - 2023\n\n\nCultutally - 2007, no contest\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2007 wins this one. Although 2023 was the more chanfeful year politically, 2007 was a thousand times more changeful culturally and just the more well rounded year",

        "selftext": "Here are some examples:\n\n\n2020 vs 2008 (two super shift election years where a Democrat won the election. Also both years had an economic catastrophy happen in them)\n\n\n2021 vs 2009 (both very transitional years that saw the inauguration of a new president, but both cancel each other out, with 2021 being the most changeful year politically but 2009 being the most changeful year culturally. Also, while the aftershock of the recession dominated news headlines in 2009, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to dominate news headlines in 2021)\n\n\n2022 vs 2003 (both political and cultural shift years that saw the beginning of a decade defining war two years after a generation defining historical event, with the Iraq War beginning two years after 9/11 and the Russia-Ukraine War beginning two years after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic)\n\n\n2023 vs 2002 (both political build-up years that were culturally stagnant)\n\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\n\n2001 vs 2020 (both super shift years)\n\n\n2023 vs 2007 (both build-up years)\n\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\n\nShift Battle No. 1 - 2020 vs 2008\n\n\nPolitically - 2020, but there's nothing in it\n\n\nCulturally - 2008\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2008 wins this one. Both years are inseparable politically so it comes down to which year was most changeful culturally, and that was 2008\n\n\nShift Battle No. 2 - 2021 vs 2009\n\n\nPolitically - 2021\n\n\nCulturally - 2009\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2009 wins this one. Although 2021 waw clearly the most changeful year politically, 2009 was just the more well rounded year \n\n\nShift Battle No. 3 - 2022 vs 2003\n\n\nPolitically - 2022\n\n\nCulturally - 2003\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2003 wins this one. Like the 2020 vs 2008 shift battle, both years are inseparable politically, so it comes down to which year was more changeful culturally, so 2003 is the winner\n\n\nShift Battle No. 4 - 2023 vs 2002\n\n\nPolitically - 2023\n\n\nCulturally - 2002 (you'd have to go back to the 1940s or the 1950s to find a year as culturally stagnant as 2023. Although 2002 was stagnant too, it's not in the same league of emptiness as 2023)\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2023 wins this one, as it had major events such as the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, the Trump indictment and the rise of AI. That being said, 2023 would lose in a shift battle against most 2000s years as it was too cultutally stagnant\n\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\n\nShift Battle No. 5 - 2020 vs 2001\n\n\nPolitically - 2020\n\n\nCulturally - 2001\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2001 wins this one. Both years are inseparable politically, but 2001 was definately the most changeful year culturally \n\n\nShift Battle No. 6 - 2023 vs 2007\n\n\nPolitically - 2023\n\n\nCulturally - 2007, no contest\n\n\nOverall Winner - 2007 wins this one. Although 2023 was the more chanfeful year politically, 2007 was a thousand times more changeful culturally and just the more well rounded year",

What they forget is that personality is subjective and it's not always good to like someone for their personality. Trump is liked by people because of his personality, namely an awful, arrogant one. I'd rather vote for a boring politician (Nikki Haley/DeSantis) with the right positions rather than a bombastic one like Trump. Likewise with dating, I'm into serious, conservative women and don't find those who go clubbing and partying every week attractive. I don't care how witty or funny you are, our values don't align.\n\nI watched a few episodes of the Jerry Springer Show, particularly the one where the boyfriend's mom told his gf that he was cheating on her. The girl (Brook) was attractive, and I thought first, \"why is she with that guy\", then when the other girl came on the show, they were cussing and fighting while other pretty women on the show went \"Jerry, Jerry!\" Next time someone tells me that personality matters because they see \"ugly dudes with pretty women\", I'll ask them if they are Jerry Springer-types: party, cussing, tattoos, piercings, etc. No thanks. I may be boring to some people, but not others.",

I'm speaking from my own circle and people I know loosely around it and from the odd discussion with strangers. I'm not using that as a basis for the entire country.\n\nIt just seems to me lately that during the rise of Trump and Brexit I couldn't move for mentions of either of them in person and in chats. The amount of memes and reminders I got during the pandemic involving Trump, Boris, Farage and co were staggering. Then the discussions which were of the \"All American's are fat, racist thicks, all Brits' are Royal worshipping, racist thicks. All across the board.\" variety. I remember coming out of a meeting to take a phone call from a family member thinking it was an emergency only for them to be ringing me about what Boris had been up to that afternoon. I've sat in rooms with these people and the talk goes on for hours. and good luck to you if you're from either country and happen to be in the same room as them, you'll never hear the end of it.\n\nSo my point is. If you turn to these people and mention the riots in Dublin, the Hotel burnings, the marches against immigration, they button up and look at you as if you've just dragged mud in and kicked your boots up on the sofa. I remember turning to one fella who was in the middle of a fairly full on anti US rant and suggested that we might have some problems of our own to sort out. A hotel had just been burned down in our neck of the woods. He turned to me, sniffed and told me that he didn't wish to discuss Irish politics as he's heard enough and stormed out of the room to his bedroom. The guy's fifty five! A lot of my family members would act in the same way.\n\nSo as I said. I don't think what I've seen or heard speaks for the entire country. I'm sorry if this comes across as an I hate Ireland rant,that's not how I feel at all! I'm well aware that we're not the only nation that has people who think and act this way. It's just something I think we could do without to be honest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Yeah, I totally can. Frankly, the lack of real outrage is not surprising to me. \n\n***Because of course he did.***\n\nThis wasn't even his idea - Lee Greenwood's been hocking this shit since 2019. It's perfect for the MAGA grift: The Bible, Constitution, and Bill of Rights contained in this handsome $59.99, faux-leather-and-gold bound edition are all public domain. Nothing to license. No pesky lawsuits for copyright infringement. \n\nPressing up 10,000 copies is probably at a max unit cost of $4/ea for \"CIC Holdings, LLC\" (Ben Meiselas did the proper deep dig on the website's fine print - 'CIC' references 'Commander in Chief' - an LLC based out of an empty lot in Montana with Trump as every member of the board of directors.\n\nBy the by, the fine print stipulates that the profits do *not* benefit Trump's campaign or SaveAmerica PAC. But they *do* benefit his shell company. You're paying Trump for the Bible - a book that any church would happily give you for free if you didn't have a copy.\n\n***This should surprise nobody, but should outrage everyone.***\n\nI'm not religious. In fact, I am deeply anti-religious when it comes to the pandering \"In God We Trust, Inc\" salvation-for-profit industry. But were I a member of the church, this godless charlatan selling the Bible at a handsome markup. \n\nAgain, not trying to open up a theology debate - you're free to worship whomever, however, and why-ever you so choose - that is a right afforded to you as an American. But spirituality-for-dollars would offend me far more were I a religious person.\n\n***The selling-Bibles-for-sixty-bucks part is the least offensive thing.***\n\nIn his hastily-made launch video for GodUSABaldEaglesAndGunsTrumpyTrumpBible dot com, he not only (unsurprisingly) panders to Christians that they are being oppressed and attacked by a host of liberal, leftist bogeymen - but he says, \"we need to **Make America Pray Again**,\" riffing off his famous campaign slogan (which was shamelessly stolen from Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign without attribution). \n\nThat's fucking terrifying. And beyond ironic, considering the included Bill of Rights opens right up with the Establishment Clause. No, America does not need to pray again. If you want to, fine - you've been doing it anyways. And the assumption is safely that prayer here is exclusive to using the Bible - not the Quran, Torah, etc.. The word \"Make\" in the phrase should shake people to their core, no matter how exhausted we are with his fascistic pronouncements by now. \n\n**TLDR: Trump will slap his name on anything for a quick buck - so long as there are rubes out there in the market for wine, steaks, college, condos, guns, bibles, or god-only-knows-what-else.** ",

According to Axios:\n\n\"Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, generated a total of $3.38 million in revenue for the first nine months of 2023.\n\nIt reports a $49 million net loss during the same period, including around $26 million in Q3.\n\nThe company's cash-on-hand dwindled to just $1.8 million at the end of September, compared to $2.4 million at the end of June, while its total liabilities climbed nearly 72% to $60.5 million\"\n\nI'm not aware of any other company ever being valued at 2,366x revenue, let alone profit.  It's obviously just a way to give money to Trump while avoiding the normal limitations one might have on giving a politician money, plus some amount of grift from Trump squeezing money from his followers.  \n\nAre there any laws he is at risk of violating here?\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2024/01/18/trump-truth-social-lose-money-profit-revenue-decline",

I'd say this is precisely analogous: Truth Social has had some revenue from ad sales and expects more explosive sales as their use increases.\n\nNow, Verona may fizzle out, and the FDA may not approve ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD patients.

He hated them because it was obviously inappropriate to wear something like that at a place where kids will inevitably be. I remember not understanding consciously, but subconsciously knowing it was super cringe. \n\nReminiscing about these stickers also made me think of  the image of poor little Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes being molested to look like he was peeing on something. Around my parts, it was most often either the #3 for Dale Earnhardt Sr., or 24 for Jeff Gordon. \n\nI feel like the bumper stickers are what empowered the idiots to cover their vehicles in stupid, classless Trump stickers we see today. \n\nAnd I feel that the Big Johnson shirts predated \"jacked up trucks\" being driven not as farm equipment but as an aesthetic to an entire personality, and the Johnson shirts were replaced with the jacked up trucks. \n\nAlso, the Big Johnson Co is still alive and well. Thriving, even, it seems. I noticed they're only 22 bucks though. Reasonably priced, yes, but still below the average price of something like this these days. I'm assuming demand hasn't been too high in recent years? My man wasn't raised around rednecks and white trash like I was and didn't know anything about the Johnson shirts. I showed him some on the website. I wanted to keep looking to see if they had a Trump Big Johnson shirts (I am sure they do), but after seeing like 5 of them, he was like \"ok, that's enough. I'm good on the big Johnson shirts\". I guess he had his fill for the day. \n\nAlso, if I didn't hate bumper stickers so much, I would consider having one of Calvin Pissing on Trump made, just to piss off all the Big Johnsons of my town lol.",

Passion means wanting to work on the cutting edge.\n\nSo Rocket Lab\u2019s ability to close the gap even to the 100th degree will not be possible and he expects long term for not enough room for two players.\n\nHe pointed out that this is a good case of winner takes all as talent is king and if you can\u2019t attract talent you can\u2019t succeed. And not to mention Elon being able to suck up to Trump definitely helps since the business is so dependant on government contracts and Trump is notoriously fond of only helping those loyal to him. Peter Beck seems fairly apolotical outwardly.\n\nHe said that to many of the brightest minds it\u2019s SpaceX or bust.\n\nI was kind of speechless and it really had me questioning things as I\u2019ve been a huge Rocket Lab following and had never thought about any of this from an insiders perspective.\n\nWhat do others think of this?\nAre you still confident in your investment?\n \n\n\n\n",

From what my friends say and from actual reports from space companies, Rocketlab isn\u2019t behind in what it does. Not everything it does is the same as SpaceX. SpaceX is the best at what it does, hands down. But that doesn\u2019t mean rocketlab is far behind for what they do. SpaceX is the bigger name which will attract talent on its own, but most people who work at SpaceX just do a couple years to get the name on their resume and transition to better work environments. Pretty similar to Big4 in finance. \n\n\n\nRocketlab has very good software and hardware that many companies and the DoD use. None of those companies complain about outdated tech there. They attract plenty of talent, I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s the absolute best talent, but it\u2019s good enough. I do know Peter Beck is considered one of the best tho and they have him. Which they admit in their 10K is actually a risk, if Peter Beck leaves it would have a material impact to the companies ability to develop tech.",

At the same time, I also think pro choice advocates have intentionally exaggerated what is and isn\u2019t legal in certain states to generate outrage. I can\u2019t tell you how many users here I have seen angry about ectopic pregnancies, but I have yet to find a single piece of legislation that disallows for medical abortions for that particular use case.",

I can\u2019t tell you how many users here I have seen angry about ectopic pregnancies, but I have yet to find a single piece of legislation that disallows for medical abortions for that particular use case.",

The only thing he did was buy twitter, renamed it X like a jackass, unbanned some people, and made everyone pay for the so called freedom of speech that twitter lacked. And conservatives licked it up.\n\nThey believe Elon Musk and Trump to be right wingers, when in fact, they are ex democrats. And most likely still hold many of those same views. Is it that easy to manipulate people on the right? \n\nElon Musk is pandering to the right and selling them \u201cFreedom of Speech\u201d  but the right is no stranger to bending knee to corporations and their bosses. \n\nPeople on the right believe Elon Musk likes Texas because it is so much better and is based yet they still have the $7.25 minimum wage while their cities are no cheaper. \n\nTexas is very business friendly to the point of crushing workers rights and treating them horribly. Of course Musk would like a state that does that. \n\nRepublicans in the state love to poke fun at people leaving blue states for Texas and saying \u201cdon\u2019t you vote blue\u201d not realizing many if not all of the people coming from California are right leaning people in the first place. \n\nEver holding the stereotype of ignorance. \n\nAgain, sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this ",

Givey was attacked and his family threatened in an attempt to discredit Givey as a witness. The same thing happened to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Larry Nassar, Jerry Sandusky for years, where law enforcement refused to take a criminal complaint as they continued abuse victims for decades. The federal courts fabricated claims that it attributed to Givey in an attempt to make Givey\u2019s claims appear outrageous. Givey like every United States citizen has the First Amendment Right to Petition the government for the redress of grievances. The act of filing a criminal complaint is an exercise of your First Amendment Right to Petition the government for the redress of grievances.\nThe question before the Supreme Court is \u201cCan the DOJ refuse to take a criminal complaint from Givey?\u201d",

Companies like Maersk are facing stock price pressures as they navigate the fallout from this infrastructure failure.\n3. **Streaming-Only NFL Games**: Amazon Prime Video and Comcast's Peacock have secured streaming-only rights for NFL games, highlighting the ongoing shift in content consumption from traditional broadcast to digital platforms, a move that could have broader implications for the media landscape.\n4. **Luxury Market Resilience**: Despite pressures on Chinese consumers, Barclays analysts have expressed confidence in the enduring appeal of luxury brands, recommending LVMH stock as a buy. The resilience of high-end consumer goods suggests a bifurcated market where luxury persists even in broader economic downturns.\n5. **Trade Tensions and EV Ambitions**: China is poised to challenge President Biden's electric vehicle initiatives at the World Trade Organization (WTO), potentially igniting trade tensions and impacting the EV market's regulatory environment and investment landscape.\n6. **Delivery Giant's Downturn**: UPS stock has taken a hit despite the company setting financial targets above Wall Street estimates, indicating investor skepticism or broader concerns about the logistics sector's ability to maintain growth in a possibly cooling economic climate.\n7. **Financial Sector Reform**: Visa and Mastercard have agreed to a landmark settlement to lower credit card fees, a move that could reshape the payment processing industry and alleviate some cost pressures for merchants, potentially leading to more competitive pricing dynamics.\n8. **Defense Sector Dynamics**: Investors are advised to keep a close eye on the defense sector, as geopolitical tensions could influence which companies emerge as winners and losers. Stock selection in this industry will require careful analysis of government spending patterns and international relations.\n9. **Consumer Confidence Wanes**: The latest consumer confidence metrics have dipped, reflecting growing pessimism about the economy's future. This sentiment could presage a more cautious spending behavior, impacting retail and cyclical stocks.\n10. **Economic Indicators to Watch**: As the market braces for the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, there is speculation about potential impacts on Federal Reserve policy and the timing of interest rate adjustments. Investors are weighing the likelihood of continued inflationary pressures against the backdrop of a complex global economic landscape.",

        "selftext": "https://www.johnlocke.org/bidens-dubious-political-origin-story-probed/\n\nThis would be funny and cute if it weren\u2019t being told by THE PRESIDENT!!\n\nJoseph Simonson and Andrew Kerr write for the Washington Free Beacon about the latest questionable statements from President Biden.\n\nFor nearly two decades, President Joe Biden has told a story about why he devoted his life to politics. Speaking to Special Counsel Robert Hur in October 2023, he told it under oath.\n\nFresh out of law school and working as a clerk at a high-powered Wilmington, Delaware, law firm, Biden, in his telling, was tapped to defend a construction company sued by a 23-year-old welder who \u201clost part of his penis and one of his testicles\u201d to a fire that broke out when he was working inside a chimney at a Delaware City plant. Thanks to Biden\u2019s shrewd legal defense on the construction company\u2019s behalf, the injured man lost the case.\n\n\u201cI wrote this memo. And son of a b\u2014, it prevailed,\u201d Biden told Hur on Oct. 8. \u201cAnd I looked over at that kid\u2026and I thought, \u2018son of a b\u2014, I\u2019m in the wrong business, I\u2019m not made for this.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden said he was so wracked with guilt that he concocted an excuse to avoid a celebratory lunch with one of the firm\u2019s named partners and walked into the public defender\u2019s office to ask for a job that very day. It\u2019s \u201cthe only time I ever lied,\u201d Biden told Hur on Oct. 8. Thus began, according to a New York Times report on the special counsel interview, \u201ca career that would one day take him to the White House.\u201d\n\nBut this story is almost certainly a complete work of fiction.\n\nAlthough Biden did work at a law firm tapped to defend a construction company in a negligence suit like the one he described to Hur, the case concluded in 1968, while Biden was still in law school. And the welder won, walking away with $315,000, more than $2.8 million in 2024 dollars.",

        "selftext": "You know how RFK talks about, \"I've got 70 billion cousins!\" Well, that's about how many older family members I have! \ud83d\ude02. Most of them are on the conservative end of politics and most of them are consumed with 24/7 Fake News.  So, obviously, their opinion of him hasn't been that great.   \n\nAnytime politics have come up in the last 8 months or so, I go all in on RFKs beliefs,  plans and what he wants to accomplish as President.   Early on they laughed at me, \"it's a waste of a vote\" was said hundreds of times and telling me he stands no chance whatsoever.  I'm also \"helping Biden win the election.\" \n\nLet's fast forward to today.  My mother in law is on board.  She's a fan of long form interviews, and once she watched one she was hooked and she needed to hear more!!  So I got one older GenX on board! lol.   The rest of them? Well, yesterday, led to 2 things.  \n\n1. Some of them are now scared, scared that he's actually picking up steam and this campaign is really starting to move.   They didn't laugh at me yesterday, they took RFK a little more seriously after the VP announcement yesterday.\n\n2. Some of the Boomers, surprisingly, are starting to come around.  Yesterday, for a lot of them, was the first time they actually *listened* to what he said and they actually *listened* to what Shanahan said as well; instead of getting clips and hit pieces from the lying MSM.    We had more constructive conversation yesterday without me being laughed at or told, \"That's a waste of a vote.\" \n\nThe older generation is really starting to notice, and like RFK said recently, once he starts advertising they'll come around.   The MSM can keep silencing him or reporting the lowest possible polling numbers they can find (or make up), but this train is picking up speed!!!\n\nKennedy24 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2",

        "selftext": "As the general election kicks off this spring, however, those calls have quieted\u2014because Biden\u2019s resurgence is coming into focus. While the president still faces serious obstacles to a second term, several important data points are lining up to demonstrate he is picking up badly needed momentum.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, there\u2019s good news for Biden on the polling front. Gradual improvements in the battleground states along with an uptick in his approval rating led one Democratic strategist, Simon Rosenberg, to declare \u201cthe Biden bump.\u201d\n\nThe boost is at the very least correlated with Biden\u2019s fiery State of the Union address on March 7, when he repeatedly went after his \u201cpredecessor\u201d and made sure to mix it up with Republicans in the chamber on a few occasions.\n\nSince then, Biden\u2019s team has continued the punchy, combative tone on display that night, using press releases to cheekily slam their legally challenged opponent as \u201cBroke Don.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the Biden campaign has continued to flex what has always been its core strength: fundraising.\n\nThe tide is turning, a Biden adviser argued to The Daily Beast, and although they aren\u2019t putting too much stock into any recent polling upticks, the president\u2019s team is ready to seize upon April and May as a crucial time to ambush a wounded Trump campaign.",

        "selftext": "Many Americans are unenthusiastic about a November rematch of the 2020 presidential election. But presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump appears to stoke more anger and fear among Americans from his opposing party than President Joe Biden does from his.\n\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Democrats are more likely to report feeling \u201cfearful\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d about the prospects of another Trump term than Republicans are about the idea of Biden remaining in the White House.\n\nThe emotional reaction Trump inspires may work in his favor too, though, since the poll also found that Republicans are more excited about the prospect of a Trump win than Democrats are about a Biden victory.\n\nTrump has countered with searing attacks on Biden\u2019s mental acuity and physical fitness for the presidency and even mocked Biden\u2019s stutter. But the latest poll results suggest Trump has not yet maximized the potential benefits of those attacks \u2014 or perhaps that they simply have a lower yield for him.\n\nBiden sometimes turns his version of the argument into a humorous quip he used often in 2020, when he was vying to unseat Trump: \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that is what resonates with reluctant Democrats and some independents.",

Turkey is [already on track](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-11/mapping-turkey-s-expanding-global-military-footprint-in-2024) to becoming the biggest seller of the artillery shells to the US as early as this year. \n\nRussia\u2019s two-year war in Ukraine has triggered a surge in global demand for ammunition, with Western allies pushing to supply Kyiv even as they replenish their own depleted stocks. The demand spike has led to a backlog in global orders and put a strain on defense supply chains, particularly on components such as TNT, the officials said on condition of anonymity. \n\nThe dealmaking with Ankara also lays bare [a delicate balance](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/turkey-walks-tightrope-between-us-and-russia-in-diplomacy-puzzle)between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, whose relations have been strained by Russia\u2019s invasion and Turkey\u2019s [months-long blockade](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/turkish-parliament-votes-to-ratify-sweden-s-entry-into-nato-lrqrp60d) of Sweden\u2019s accession to the military alliance. \n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to visit the White House on May 9 for the first time since President Joe Biden took office as the two smooth over military ties. Turkey\u2019s approval of Sweden\u2019s NATO membership this year [cleared the way](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-11/us-proceeds-with-23-billion-warplane-missile-sale-to-turkey) for Washington to sign off on a $23 billion sale of American-made F-16 warplanes, missiles and bombs to Ankara.\n\nThe partnership on ammunition production would build on that. The Pentagon in late February said it contracted General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to build three 155mm projectile metal parts lines in Texas, including with Turkish subcontractors. The plant in Mesquite, Texas, is scheduled to move into production in June, the company said.\n\n### Catching Up With Moscow\n\nProduction lines of Turkish defense firm Repkon are expected to produce some 30% of all US-made 155mm artillery shells by 2025, the people said. In addition, the Defense Department purchased 116,000 rounds of battle-ready ammunition from Turkey\u2019s Arca Defense for delivery this year, with further purchases expected soon for delivery next year, the people added. \n\nIn a statement on the Texas investment and Turkish industry, the Pentagon said working with allies \u201cis key to building a global defense industrial base.\u201d Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry and defense-procurement agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nThe US and European efforts are part of a race to [catch up with Moscow](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-11/momentum-shifting-toward-russia-in-ukraine-war-us-spies-warn), whose war machine has put it in a position to produce or procure \u2014 according to some estimates \u2014 4 million rounds this year, [including shipments](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/north-korea-speeds-up-pace-of-secretive-weapons-shipments-to-putin) from North Korea. By contrast, the European Union expects to triple its production of artillery shells this year to around 1.4 million units.\n\nAs big defense companies and smaller suppliers start to ramp up production, US and European ammunition output is expected to significantly increase next year and the year after, Western officials say.\n\nBut that depends in part on the US Congress approving more than $60 billion [earmarked for Ukraine](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/pentagon-lists-priorities-to-arm-ukraine-replenish-stockpile), currently blocked by House Republicans demanding concessions on migration. The US Army aims to produce 100,000 155mm shells a month by late 2025, which won\u2019t be possible without the funds, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said in late February.   \n\n\nThe US ammunition partnership with Turkey also [exposes a divergence](https://archive.is/o/RVh4B/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/europe-needs-to-ramp-up-defenses-to-threats-von-der-leyen-warns) in strategy with the EU. For months, the 27-member bloc held back from using funds for purchases from Turkey because of resistance from France, Greece and Cyprus \u2014 even as it had to postpone its goal to send Ukraine 1 million shells by March until the end of the year on lagging production.  \n\n\n*\u2014 With assistance from Firat Kozok*\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "The former president has already won the state once and President Joe Biden, who reclaimed it for Democrats in 2020, is confronting vulnerabilities there as he seeks reelection. Trump\u2019s campaign promises an aggressive play for Michigan as part of a robust swing-state strategy.\n\nBut, at least for now, those promises appear to be mostly talk. The Trump campaign and its partners at the Republican National Committee haven\u2019t yet made significant general election investments in the state, according to Michigan Republican Party Chairman Pete Hoekstra. The national committee, he said, hasn\u2019t transferred any money to the state party to help bolster its operations heading into the general election. There are no specific programs in place to court voters of color. And there\u2019s no general election field staff in place.\n\nIt\u2019s much the same in presidential battleground states across the country, according to Republican operatives and party officials involved in campaign planning elsewhere.\n\nWidely praised for its professionalism and effectiveness throughout the primary phase of the 2024 election, Trump\u2019s political operation has been slow to pivot toward the general election in the weeks after executing a hostile takeover of the Republican Party\u2019s national political machinery. In fact, the former president\u2019s team has rolled back plans under previous leaders to add hundreds of staff and dozens of new minority-outreach centers in key states without offering a clear alternative.\n\nIndeed, just six months before the first early votes are cast in the general election between Trump and Biden, Trump\u2019s Republican Party has little general election infrastructure to speak of.\n\nOfficials on the ground in top swing states are not panicking, but the disparity with the Biden campaign is stark.\n\nThis month alone, Biden opened 100 new offices and added more than 350 new staffers in swing states from Arizona to Georgia to Pennsylvania, according to campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa. That\u2019s in addition to the Democratic president\u2019s existing battleground-state staff of 100 that was already in place.\n\nFacing internal pushback on some of the cuts, Lara Trump has vowed that the committee\u2019s half-dozen existing community centers would remain open. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s team will follow through on McDaniel\u2019s plans to open an additional 40 community centers in the coming months. Amid such optimism, however, there is also a deep sense of uncertainty as Trump\u2019s team rewrites the party\u2019s 2024 battleground-state strategy after burning the previous playbook.",

One was successful, one was not. \n\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because Biden is our party\u2019s best weapon right now. He matches up against Trump in a way that no one, not even Obama, can. Biden is the perfect antithesis of Trumpism and that\u2019s what makes him so effective against Trump. \n\nIn other words \u2014 the media needs to stop explicitly, or implicitly, suggesting that Biden is some feeble old man who can\u2019t beat Trump without Obama riding in on a white horse to save the day.\n\nBiden beat Trump once. When everyone said Biden was in trouble or needs to change course, he held steady and his strategy paid off. We\u2019re already seeing a bump in the polls and the campaign is just starting. Biden knows what he is doing. I trust Diamond Joe.",

Somebody did. In an era of 7% mortgages!*\n\nOkay! The Federal Reserve began raising rates in 2021. Can we check and see if the cake is finally baked?\n\nNormal people - those who don't obsess over government manipulation of currency and interest rates - may only be dimly aware that since early 2021 Fed Funds rates skyrocketed from around 1% to 5.33% today. According to several government spokespersons, this was to fight inflation. So how are we doing?\n\nHousing is now rising faster than before. WTH? How can something like that happen? (see link below).\n\nEvidently jacking up mortgage rates has little effect on home prices in these modern times. Or grocery prices - President Biden demanded a congressional investigation into supermarkets last week. Or fuel prices. My local gas station is charging $3.39 a gallon this month. It was $2.39 on inauguration day. That's an increase of 42%!!!\n\nGood thing the federal government excludes food, fuel, and housing from its basic inflation measures. However, I'm sure that some cheerleader for the present administration is going to scour the internet to find at least one or two things whose prices went down. Go ahead and get started, while I continue today's column.\n\nHere's a thought experiment. What if you asked a sample of voters . . . do you want mortgage rates, car loans, and credit cards to soar out of sight, they probably would have answered no. Same thing with a 42% rise in gas prices. Or new home prices. Or food prices. Those things are what most of our money is spent on. If your doctor prescribed a strong medicine, but you kept keep getting sicker and sicker, wouldn't you ask for a second opinion, from a different doctor? Evidently what we've been taking doesn't cure anything.\n\nLet me inoculate myself against the trolls screaming \u201cbut you love Trump\u201d. I don't for a moment believe Trump cares about - or has a plan to rein in - housing prices. Someone who lives in a $100 million mansion but doesn't know how much it's actually worth is the LAST person I want messing with mortgage rates and home prices.\n\nWe're drowning in inflation. The solution to housing affordability is obviously NOT to jack up interest rates. Affordable housing clearly involves building more homes. The last several years America has built fewer homes \u2013 about 50% fewer \u2013 than the rate of population growth. The logical endpoint of failing to build enough homes is that most of us could be homeless eventually. Or living in soviet style public housing blocks. Shouldn't this be a 2024 election issue?\n\nI'm just sayin' . . .\n\n[**There\u2019s more bad news for potential homebuyers: Prices just hit another record | CNN Business**](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/economy/us-home-prices-january-case-shiller/index.html#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20CoreLogic%20Case%2DShiller,annual%20increase%20since%20late%202022.)

I think U6 unemployment is around 7% or double what we\u2019re being told the unemployment rate is. \n\nWhile it\u2019s easy and even logical to think this is because they\u2019re trying to ensure Biden\u2019s re-election, I think it\u2019s more likely that there isn\u2019t really anything the federal government and federal reserve can do to fight inflation short of triggering a recession, so they\u2019re just pretending everything is dandy. \n\nI remember people saying the fed can\u2019t raise rates much above 5% else the US can\u2019t service its debt? Something like that? Someone smarter than I can probably correct me.",

He favors withholding the most basic protection of the law, that against deliberately ending a life, to unborn children: a denial of the human equality that grounds American democracy. He would break with long-standing policy to make Americans pay to abort the children of the poor. Biden\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 he reversed successful measures to control border crossings in a fit of ideology and partisanship \u2014 has been astonishingly reckless. So, too, his record on spending. Under Biden, we are running large deficits during years of economic expansion, even as a potential debt crisis gets closer \u2014 a failing he shares with his predecessor.\nThen there is the question of character. Trump\u2019s biography is very nearly a compendium of the seven deadly sins. Biden lies so frequently, and so often pointlessly \u2014 he isn\u2019t winning one extra vote by pretending he got arrested in South Africa resisting apartheid \u2014 as to suggest a compulsion. He has, at the very least, helped his family cash in on his career in government. He looks good only in comparison with Trump.\n\nIf you are a double hater, then why does this sound like its written by one of Trump's campaign staff?",

He was trailing Donald Trump in almost all of the key battleground states, as well as in national polling averages. Influential liberals were so concerned that the octogenarian incumbent did not have another campaign in him that some were openly calling for him to be replaced as the nominee.  \n\n\nAs the general election kicks off this spring, however, those calls have quieted\u2014because Biden\u2019s resurgence is coming into focus. While the president still faces serious obstacles to a second term, several important data points are lining up to demonstrate he is picking up badly needed momentum.  \n\n\nFor the first time in a long time, there\u2019s good news for Biden on the polling front. Gradual improvements in the battleground states along with an uptick in his approval rating led one Democratic strategist, Simon Rosenberg, to declare \u201cthe Biden bump.\u201d  \n\n\nThe boost is at the very least correlated with Biden\u2019s fiery State of the Union address on March 7, when he repeatedly went after his \u201cpredecessor\u201d and made sure to mix it up with Republicans in the chamber on a few occasions.  \n\n\nSince then, Biden\u2019s team has continued the punchy, combative tone on display that night, using press releases to cheekily slam their legally challenged opponent as \u201cBroke Don.\u201d  \n\n\nOn top of that, the Biden campaign has continued to flex what has always been its core strength: fundraising.  \n\n\nWith a $53 million haul in February, the Biden campaign built on their already impressive financial advantage over Trump, who brought in only $20 million over the same period. The Biden campaign has $71 million in cash on hand, compared to just $33.5 million for Trump.  \n\n\nThe tide is turning, a Biden adviser argued to The Daily Beast, and although they aren\u2019t putting too much stock into any recent polling upticks, the president\u2019s team is ready to seize upon April and May as a crucial time to ambush a wounded Trump campaign.",

This year's byelections were about 24%, which is mild by the standards of such things.

The Chancellor looks likely to step down rather than defend a \\~9000 majority in Surrey, for example.  \n\nAs I understand it that's totally unlike the USA, not because of the two party system per se, but because there are very few swing voters: the vast majority vote tribally, and the parties are left squabbling over a small number of persaudable voters and various attacks on turnout.",

        "selftext": " \n\n# Radio host shocked by Karine Jean-Pierre abruptly ending interview: 'I don't understand the fragility'\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre appeared to abruptly end a radio interview from a local North Carolina station after being asked about inflation and rising prices.\n\nBy Lindsay Kornick\n\nMar 27, 2024 07:55 AM\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre ended an interview with a local North Carolina radio station on Tuesday rather suddenly, to the surprise of the reporter and host.\n\nThe White House press secretary spoke to 99.3 WBT Charlotte News Director Mark Garrison ahead of President Biden\u2019s visit to Raleigh. Garrison spoke on \"The Brett Winterble Show\" about the experience, where clips from the interview were played.\u00a0\n\nAt one point, Garrison questioned whether Biden has \"dementia,\" stating that \"a number of people\" he told about the interview requested that he ask her that.\n\nJean-Pierre called the question \"incredibly offensive\" and called out Garrison for \"taking us down this rabbit hole.\"\n\nAfter defending Biden\u2019s record, she said, \"And so I\u2019m not even going to truly, truly, really, you know, take, take the premise of your question. I think it is incredibly insulting. And, and so we can, you know, we can move on to the next question.\"\n\nIn his next question, he asked Jean-Pierre about rising gas and grocery prices.\n\n\"How does Mr. Biden win votes when people don\u2019t have as much disposable income?\" Garrison asked.\n\n\"Look, the president understands. He grew up in a middle-class, working-class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He gets it. He understands how difficult it is for Americans who are sitting around their kitchen table every month trying to figure out what they\u2019re going to pay for. You have to remember, when the president walked into this administration, there were multiple crises happening,\" Jean-Pierre replied.\n\nShe continued, \"There was COVID, the economy was in a tailspin because of the last administration, because of what President Trump left us with. Now you\u2019re asking me about gas prices. The president took action on gas prices. Let\u2019s not forget Russia\u2019s invasion on Ukraine skyrocketed prices of gas. And because the president took action, we see we are in a different place than we were a year ago in gas prices. Eggs, milk, seafood products, all the important groceries, those costs have gone down because of what this president has been able to do.\"\u00a0\n\n\"And, and with that, thank you so much, Mark. Have an amazing, amazing day,\" Jean-Pierre closed before abruptly ending the call.\n\nAfter Jean-Pierre abruptly ended the call, a busy signal could be heard and Winterble reacted in shock, \"Wow, wow, wow,\" while Garrison laughed.\n\n\"Listen, I am nominating you to get a press corps badge, and you need to go to the White House,\" Winterble told Garrison. \"I\u2019m sorry, but you asked three, four incredibly salient, important questions that are all front of mind. Nothing out of bounds. No baba booeying or anything like that, right? And you did it exactly right on. I don\u2019t understand the fragility of this person.\"\n\nGarrison noted that it was the White House that reached out for the interview, \"I was supposed to get more time with her and the fact that, all of a sudden, she decided to just hang up the phone took me by surprise because I had a couple of questions that weren\u2019t as controversial. But I\u2019ll never get to ask them, I guess.\"\n\nGarrison revealed that additional clips of the interview would likely be released in a morning show. Radio host Pete Kaliner later aired more audio from the interview on his show, remarking that the full raw footage was approximately six minutes.\n\nIn a comment to Fox News Digital, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said, \"As she often does when the President travels, Karine had multiple back-to-back interviews with radio stations who were each offered 7 minutes. Once the agreed-upon time was over, she called into the next interview so everyone could get their full time.\"\n\nHe added, \"This particular station chose not to air the full interview and instead artificially attached a sound effect that our phones do not make when calls end.\"\n\n&#x200B;",

This approach is prevalent in other opinion-based subreddits. However, in r/TrueUnpopularOpinion, we encourage a different standard:\n\n- **Upvote** a post if it provokes thought, presents a unique perspective, is well-argued, or you believe it deserves more visibility for any reason\u2014even if it irritates you or you fundamentally disagree with it.\n  \n- **Downvote** should be reserved for posts that lack thoughtful consideration or if the topic has become tediously common.\n\n**Moderation Policy:**\n\n- **Posts Are Not Removed for Unpopularity:** r/TrueUnpopularOpinion does not remove posts based on their capacity to anger or offend users. Disagreement with a post's content is not grounds for reporting.\n\n- **Misuse of the Report Button:** Falsely reporting posts burdens our moderation queue, hindering our ability to address genuine concerns swiftly.\n\n  - **All false reports are forwarded to Reddit** for actions against misuse of the reporting system.\n\n  - Our moderation decisions are guided strictly by the subreddit's rules and Reddit's content policy, not personal opinions. Misreporting in hopes of content removal due to disagreement is futile and considered 'Report Abuse.'\n\n### Upcoming Changes to Reporting System:\n\nIn response to the excessive misuse of the report button\u2014which disrupts discussion and overloads our moderators\u2014we are revising our approach to handling reports:\n\n- **Automated Report Dismissal:** Henceforth, our bot will disregard all reports automatically. Instead, a comment will prompt the reporter to contact the moderators directly via ModMail.\n\n  - This change aims to ensure that only those serious about a rule or policy violation will take the time to report, as they will be encouraged to substantiate their claims through ModMail.\n\n**Stay Informed:** Further details on these changes will be announced. We appreciate your cooperation in fostering a respectful and engaging discussion environment.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

But that's not what happened. The administration just flagged posts for the providers that violated the providers' own policies (i.e., Covid misinformation). Based on the oral argument at the Supreme Court, I think the Supreme Court is very likely to side with the Biden administration on this.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump tried to illegally seize power after he lost the 2020 election ... How is that not a bigger threat to democracy? It's a basic principle of any democracy that a president has to peacefully leave office if he loses re-election. But Trump tried various illegal schemes to overthrow the results of the election. For example, he pressured Pence to throw out the votes of tens of millions of American citizens. Trump is currently facing federal criminal charges in DC for his attempt to stage a coup.\n\nIn terms of danger to democracy, those two things aren't even in the same universe...\n\nAnd if you really believe that the Biden administration tried to \"censor\" speech, well Trump did the same thing.

An incredible amount of hypocrisy in your post given the \u201cfreedom loving\u201d states and sponsors are the most restrictive regarding human rights and liberties within the U.S. other than firearms.\n\nDon\u2019t care for Biden a ton myself but given your post history there\u2019s a heavy agenda here.\n\nIt\u2019s sheep* by the way.  Meanwhile MAGA have been parroting the same verbiage for eight years while calling others sheep, and they\u2019re too dense to grasp the irony.",

And they are actually using Bluetooth technology that\u2019s connected to the skimmers inside the stores. So it's like a two for one, getting cash that people give them and stealing the numbers off the skimmers.\"\n\nSurveillance video obtained by the El Cajon Police Department shows suspects can place a skimmer over the checkout's credit card swipe in just seconds \u2014 and they look almost exactly like the real thing.\n\nPolice recommend tugging on a credit card swipe before inserting your card. If it wobbles or comes off, it's fake.\n\nAuthorities say they've already busted dozens of suspects, most of them with ties to organized crime in Romania.\n\nAnd despite large busts in December and January of dozens of suspects in the U.S., Europe and Mexico, where they are teaming up with cartels in tourist hot spots like Tulum, the thefts are increasing as thieves double down on their efforts, authorities said.\u00a0\n\nThey could be raking in up to $9 million a month \u2014 much of it at taxpayers' expense.\n\nThe skimmers, which can target EBT card users as well, have allegedly drained accounts the moment that the state releases monthly payments, according to Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer's office, which announced a major crackdown on such crimes earlier this year. As a result, more than $100 million worth of thefts robbed taxpayer-funded welfare programs and their recipients.\n\n\"The victims are single mothers struggling to put a roof over their children's heads and food on the table and hardworking people who need a helping hand who find themselves standing at the checkout line with bags full of groceries only to be humiliated when they find that they have no money in their account because a thief has surreptitiously taken everything,\" Spitzer said in a statement. \"Meanwhile, the thieves are using this money to fund organized crime, to buy luxury cars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and to lead a life of luxury that the true recipients can only dream about.\"\n\nOn top of that, the porous southern border gives the mobsters a steady supply of new muscle, while a combination of lax bail policies and incomplete criminal records allow members to cut off their ankle monitors and flee justice if they get arrested.\n\n\"Thousands of criminals suspected to be tied to organized Romanian crime have been identified to be in the United States, with a large portion of them entering the United States illegally, mainly through the southern border,\" Edds told Fox News Digital. \"A smaller portion of this population is entering as asylum seekers.\"\n\nA group of Southern California counties, including Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, has seen about 15% of the Romanian mob's activity within the US., she said.\n\nIn addition to sending stolen money back to Romania to fund luxe lifestyles and European sports cars, the crooks are also trading in food stamps for baby formula and energy drinks, which are then resold in Mexico in an alliance with local cartels.\n\nMany of them even flaunt their ill-gotten gains on TikTok, including a 14-year-old suspect who police captured driving a $250,000 sports car and wearing a Rolex.\n\nOne of the men implicated in the plot was already on Romania's most wanted list \u2014 Florin Duduianu.\n\nThe 39-year-old was convicted in January after police watched him make multiple withdrawals using different cards from the same ATM in Placentia, about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. They caught him with four Visa gift cards that had been reprogrammed into clones of four different victims' debit cards.\n\nDuduianu is expected to get 30 years in federal prison at his sentencing later this week, according to the Justice Department.\n\nIn December, the FBI announced it was partnering with Romanian police to raid dozens of locations in the European country connected to the California skimming thefts.\n\nThe joint operation resulted in 48 arrests and the recovery of more than $1 million and 11 luxury vehicles.\n\nMany of the suspects arrested in Romania also had ties to Mexico's Riviera Maya gang, which itself is blamed for millions of dollars in skimming thefts in tourist hot spots that are popular with Americans, including Tulum and Cancun in Quintana Roo.\n\nThe gang's leader, Florian Tudor, is awaiting trial on fraud charges in Mexico and is wanted for attempted murder in Romania, as well.",

        "selftext": "As the moderator of this subreddit, I want to make some things about this subreddit and the COVID19 pandemic itself clearer, and having said those things make explicit some new rules for the subreddit. Also, I want to bring to your attention some basic things about Marxism, since most people here are not familiar with Marxist theory. I will make reference to Dems/Reps in the context of American politics, but the things apply to every bourgeois political party in the world.\n\n# The COVID Catastrophe, Marxism, and this Subreddit\n\nThe global forever-COVID policy is a crime by capitalists and their governments, and serial mass-infection is deteriorating the health of the global population. **We are in this COVID catastrophe because the entire structure of capitalism depends on the incessant extraction of surplus value from the working class by the capitalist class, and even a momentary halt to that process threatens all of capitalism with collapse.** That is why capitalist governments have not implemented the necessary globally-coordinated public health measures to stop transmission and eliminate the virus globally, but in 2020 did swiftly enact financial bailouts, and then, after belated haphazard lockdowns, implemented an unsafe return to work. Taking the profit system as their point of departure, governments will do nothing that impinges on profit rates. The subsequent reallocation of resources at the necessary scale through a government elimination program with measures such as lockdowns to quickly break chains of transmission, society-wide contact-tracing, isolation of patients, indoor air filtration and ventilation upgrades, and the required social social supports is entirely off the table for them.\n\nThe *raison d'\u00eatre* of capitalist governments is to give the seal of legitimacy to and protect that division of resources entailed by the profit system, namely the exploitation of the working class by the capitalists, and the entire structure of capitalism founded on it, and it is not possible to solve any of the major social problems within capitalism. Firstly they exist to protect and endow capitalism with legal form, then they will not make concessions to the working class that impinge on profit rates.\n\nWorking within the frame of capitalism, the ruling class and their governments have sought the normalization of never-ending mass-infection. Governments promoted illusions that the vaccines solve the pandemic and used them as a pretext to weaken the limited and inadequate anti-COVID measures that had been enacted. Governments also downplay the significance of transmission by deceptively calling the virus \u201cendemic,\u201d and altogether dropped the pretense that they were trying to stop transmission with the arrival of Omicron.\n\nThe consciousness of the masses, in the course of their own practical activity taking place *within* the conditions (importantly including intellectual conditions) created by capitalism and its instruments of class rule (ie governments), has been given shape such that COVID has indeed been normalized. **It is the requirements of capitalism, refracted by all the spheres of society, that are expressed as the prevailing attitudes regarding the pandemic.**\n\n**The theory that grasps the connection between capitalism and the spheres taken up by the social process, from the state to individual consciousness, and therefore has a correct and objective understanding of the entire social process as a totality, is called Marxism, and genuine** ***Marxism*** **today is** ***Trotskyism***.\n\nThe pandemic, as well as all major social problems humanity faces, will not be solved by appealing to bourgeois governments or frauds like Bernard Sanders who, by being committed to capitalism, are committed to the barbarism demanded by capitalism. **Only an international movement by the working class, independent of the capitalist parties and corporatist trade unions, consciously guided by Marxist theory and aiming to overthrow capitalism, can solve the problems facing humanity.** **The only political tendency that is genuinely putting into practice Marxist theory is the** [***WSWS/ICFI***](https://www.wsws.org/en)**. As such, they play a special and unique epistemic and practical role in the class struggle and the entire social process,** and this will become increasingly clear to people as the crisis of capitalism intensifies.\n\n**The most important thing this subreddit could do is to give exposure to the things outlined above.** Clearly, the science of COVID itself and COVID news in general are very important as well, so that should also be posted, but what should distinguish this subreddit from other COVID subreddits are the above things\u2014the political aspect of COVID. I therefore highlight *WSWS* pieces and try to highlight the criminal role of bourgeois governments in making mass COVID infection permanent for the sake of capitalism. Since the US is of course at the center of world capitalism, I am in the US, and I assume most people here are as well, I especially highlight the criminal role of the Biden admin, who in the past few years has implemented the forever-COVID policy that Trump only dreamed of.\n\n# A Few More Things\n\nWe are NOT in this catastrophe because COVID \u201ccan\u2019t be eliminated\u201d, or because \u201cTrump f\u2019d it up so bad in 2020 that the Dems would love to do something but can\u2019t.\u201d We are also NOT in this catastrophe simply because of the \u201ccorporate capture\u201d of decision-making, such that we just have to \u201capply pressure\u201d and take back \u201cour\u201d governments.\n\nThe people who want to do the \u201cpragmatic\u201d thing of appealing to bourgeois governments and politicians like Sanders to solve social problems like the COVID crisis harbor the most unrealistic illusions and are under the sway of myopic appraisals of the political situation which actually guarantee further tragedy for the working class and humanity as a whole.\n\n**All bourgeois parties are committed to working within the frame of capitalism, and as such their \u201cwill\u201d proceeds within regular patterns determined by the demands of capitalism.** The Biden admin is doing their criminal mass-infection policy and deceives people by treating COVID like the flu and pretending the vaccines solved the pandemic for the same reason the Trump admin responded the way they did\u2014the most important thing for them is protecting capitalism. These are not \u201cyour\u201d governments\u2014**they are the governments of the bourgeoisie, which from the outset exist to assert capitalism.**\n\n# New Rules\n\n**If you are absolutely irreconcilably opposed to the things outlined above, leave.** Start your own subreddit for people who think the Dems or X bourgeois party are doing nothing wrong and we just have to do the \u201cpragmatic\u201d thing of begging the bourgeoisie while never-ending mass-infection deteriorates everyone\u2019s health more and more and life expectancy drops year after year.\n\nHere are the new rules:\n\n(1) No apologia for capitalism, capitalist politicians, or capitalism\u2019s global forever-covid policy\n\n* Apologia like \u201cBiden cant do anything about covid because Trump\u201d or \u201cTrump would be worse, therefore lets follow the Dems into barbarism\u201d and such is not allowed. This applies to any bourgeois parties in the world.\n\n(2) No fig leaves for COVID carelessness\n\n* COVID is deteriorating the health of the world population, it is airborne, and it is everywhere, even in troughs of transmission. If you are careless enough to do COVID-risky things, like eating indoors in restaurants, don\u2019t cover it up with a fig leaf like \u201ceveryone has a different risk tolerance\u201d or \u201cI went for drinks but with covid safety in mind,\u201d which just obscure the fact that as a potential link in transmission chains, you can put others in danger, and obscure the mix of carelessness and social pressure involved. Unless you did not choose it (for example: you can\u2019t afford masks, your workplace forced you to take off your mask, you went to the dentist, and such), do not talk about the risky things you do. If you took the decision to do risky things, do not bring it up on the subreddit in order to rationalize it.\n\n(3) No social darwinist, eugenicist, or social-murderous notions\n\n* This includes saying vile and philistine things like \u201cold people got us into this situation so better that they die\u201d or \u201ccovid is killing more Republican voters, therefore the Dems\u2019 forever-covid policy is fine by me.\u201d",
